Congress is not expected to adopt deep changes to Social Security this year. But regardless of the outcome of Republican proposals to add private accounts to the system, the nation's huge life insurance industry stands to benefit from the debate over Social Security's future.
Already, the debate has called attention to retirement concerns. Insurers have been increasingly focusing on selling investments for retirement and they are doing their best to capitalize on the attention. Moreover, if Congress does end up changing Social Security, there is a good chance any new law would favor the kind of investments called annuities that insurers love to sell.
