The biggest assignment in the history of advertising was made yesterday as the Procter & Gamble Company consolidated responsibilities for the tactical planning and buying of television commercial time in the United States -- with an estimated $1 billion to $1.2 billion in annual spending -- at a single agency.
P.& G., the nation's largest advertiser, selected Televest in New York, a unit of the MacManus Group, which specializes in media services, as its American television media agency of record. The decision, which reduces the number of agencies handling television for P.& G. to one, came after a review that had engrossed Madison Avenue since March.
