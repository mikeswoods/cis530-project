The European Commission is consulting with the computer industry over the next week on whether Microsoft is complying with last March's antitrust ruling against the company, a commission spokesman said Friday.
In addition to fining the company a record 497 million euros ($656 million), the commission ordered Microsoft to offer a second version of its Windows operating system for the European market that does not have Microsoft's Media Player software program built into it.
