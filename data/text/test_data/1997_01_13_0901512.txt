MILLIONS of men age 50 and older suffer from the symptoms of enlarged prostate. This benign condition occurs when prostate tissue, after decades of dormancy, begins to grow. The excess tissue blocks the urethra, the tube through which urine passes out of the body. As a result, sufferers often cannot empty their bladder completely and must strain to relieve themselves. But in spite of their discomfort, many men never consult a doctor, and most of those who do choose to live with the condition rather than undergo risky surgery.
Now a California medical-equipment company has patented tools and a method for treating an enlarged prostate that it says eliminates those risks. The Menlo Park company, Vidamed Inc., says its brief, out-patient procedure also costs less than half the price of conventional surgery.
