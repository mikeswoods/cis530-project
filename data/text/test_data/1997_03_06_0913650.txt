Growth stocks -- the shares of companies whose profits Wall Street expects to rise rapidly -- have been the darlings of the stock market during the 1990's. But they lagged late in 1996, and have recently been downright poor performers.
The best measure of the performance of the stocks that analysts love is a new index, the Montgomery Securities Growth Stock Index, which is based on the 500 stocks for which Wall Street expects the greatest profit growth in the coming five years or so.
