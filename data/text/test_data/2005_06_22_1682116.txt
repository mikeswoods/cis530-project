Winn-Dixie Stores, a supermarket chain centered in the South, said yesterday that it would cut 22,000 jobs, or 28 percent of its work force, and close 35 percent of its stores in an effort to fend off rivals like Wal-Mart Stores.
The moves are part of the company's latest revamping plan. Winn-Dixie, an 80-year-old chain that runs 913 stores in nine states and the Bahamas, has been operating under bankruptcy protection since February.
