It must be interesting attending parties these days at the home of Blair Levin, a securities analyst at Legg Mason who writes about Hughes Electronics and its much sought-after DirecTV division. Echostar Communications agreed to merge last October with Hughes, after trumping Rupert Murdoch and the News Corporation, which failed to come up with the $27 billion winning bid. Since then the News Corporation has been trying to scuttle the deal with the hope, some industry executives say, of restarting talks later.
That puts Mr. Levin, who like many others has been critical of Echostar, in an awkward position. Mr. Levin is married to Patty Friedman, the sister of Jan Constantine, a News Corporation executive. More important, though, that makes him the brother-in-law of Lloyd Constantine, who is married to Jan and is the News Corporation's antitrust counsel. In recent months, Mr. Constantine has been urging Washington legislators to oppose the merger.
