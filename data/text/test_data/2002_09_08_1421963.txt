FOR months, the nation's businesses have worried about a labor dispute that threatens to shut down 29 West Coast ports that handle $300 billion in cargo a year. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union has warned that 10,500 dockworkers might strike or engage in a work slowdown at ports from Seattle to San Diego, while the employers' group, the Pacific Maritime Association, has threatened to lock out the workers, a move that would shut down the ports.
The longshoremen's contract expired on July 1, and the two sides have bargained on and off since then, with the threat of a stoppage hanging over the talks.
