WHAT was Stefanie Powers, the vivacious redhead who starred in ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.,'' doing as host of a seven-part public-television series on personal finance sponsored by Merrill Lynch?
After all, the public knows Ms. Powers as either the strong-willed beauty in the 1979-85 TV show about a wealthy husband-and-wife amateur detective team, or as the mini skirted secret agent April Dancer in the 1960's spy spoof. Whether traipsing through mansions and five-star hotels in ''Hart to Hart'' or flying off to a Greek island with a dachshund whose fleas carried an antidote to an insidious poison in ''The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.,'' she oozed glamour and independence, not investment expertise.
