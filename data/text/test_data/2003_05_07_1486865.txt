The Credit Suisse Group, which promised investors a comeback in 2003 after its loss of 3.3 billion Swiss francs ($2.5 billion) last year, produced the first signs of one today. The company reported a net income of 652 million Swiss francs ($492 million) for the quarter ended March 31, nearly double the 368 million francs in profit it recorded in the period last year.
Philip K. Ryan, the chief financial officer, said that though he was pleased with the showing, the company was not yet out of the woods. As many other corporations have done recently, including UBS, a rival of Credit Suisse, Mr. Ryan was cautious and avoided offering a forecast for the full year.
