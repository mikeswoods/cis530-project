TWO airlines in crisis -- Delta and Northwest -- took steps yesterday aimed at gaining some breathing room in their attempts to avoid seeking bankruptcy protection.
Delta Air Lines, considered the sicker of the pair, said it would sell 11 Boeing 767-200 series jets for $190 million. It also said it would reduce flights from its hub in Cincinnati by 26 percent, a move that would eliminate 1,000 jobs.
