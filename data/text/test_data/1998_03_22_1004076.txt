DURING the recent stampede for mortgage refinancings, home equity loans -- consumers' solution for everything from high-interest credit card debt to college tuition -- were temporarily left behind. Now banks that want to keep the market going strong are promoting the loans aggressively.
''Are lenders ramping up offers? Yes, they are,'' said Keith T. Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a financial surveyor and publisher in Butler, N.J. ''People are refinancing and paying off their second lien. As refinancing picks up, lenders are focusing on making new lines of credit to refill their portfolios.''
