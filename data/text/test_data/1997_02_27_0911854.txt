The 3Com Corporation said today that it would acquire the U.S. Robotics Corporation in a $6.6 billion stock swap that would create the second-largest computer networking company.
The acquisition would strengthen 3Com's hand against competitors, particularly Cisco Systems Inc., the leader in computer networking, by broadening its product line.
