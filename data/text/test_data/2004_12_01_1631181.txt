Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, the tempest-tossed owner of fashion brands like Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, said on Tuesday that it planned to sell its stake in the equipment parts distributor Rexel in a deal valuing the company at 3.7 billion euros, or $4.9 billion.
The transaction will allow the highly leveraged Pinault-Printemps to pay down some 3 billion euros in debt, and focus on the luxury goods and retail markets. Investors have questioned the company's strategy in recent months after it and Tom Ford, its well-known designer, parted ways.
