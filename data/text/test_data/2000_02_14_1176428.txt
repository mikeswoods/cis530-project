EVERY reporter who has ever dreamed of a world without editors might see Jacob Weisberg as a man who has achieved nirvana. Every libertarian Internetophile who believes that the World Wide Web will democratize information might see Mr. Weisberg, Slate magazine's leading political correspondent, as the man to unlock the medium's revolutionary potential.
How, then, would the restless reporters feel if they knew that Mr. Weisberg has thousands of editors -- readers who react instantly and viscerally to his work? And how would the Net libertarians take it if they knew the political news media see Mr. Weisberg as one of their own?
