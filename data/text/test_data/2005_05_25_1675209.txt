Warren E. Buffett struck a deal on Tuesday to buy the electric utility PacifiCorp for $5.1 billion from Scottish Power, his largest purchase in eight years. Sounding a bullish note for the energy industry in general, he promised to buy similar assets in the future.
Mr. Buffett, whose investing style has been scrutinized this year because of an investigation into the insurance industry, one of his longstanding favorites, said Tuesday that energy companies were a good fit with his company, Berkshire Hathaway, because they need capital and provide steady returns.
