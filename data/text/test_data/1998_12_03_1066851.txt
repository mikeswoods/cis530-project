Newly reunited, Exxon and Mobil might have some of the heft of Standard Oil, their forefather company that once dominated the American oil industry. But they do not have the old chutzpah. The proposed colossus lacks one thing that made Standard Oil the prime target of antitrust crusaders and muckraking journalists: a Rockefeller.
Even before President Theodore Roosevelt's antitrust campaign finally shattered Standard Oil into 34 pieces in 1911, John D. Rockefeller, the founder, had retired from management. Today, many of his 140 descendants have shareholdings in Exxon, Mobil and other cousins of the Standard Oil family, but none has significant stakes or exercises control.
