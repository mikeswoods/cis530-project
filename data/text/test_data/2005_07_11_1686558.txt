In a small town in South Texas, a long legal journey will begin this week for Merck, the giant drug maker, and thousands of people who suffered heart attacks and strokes after taking its painkiller Vioxx.
On Thursday, opening arguments are expected to start in a state court in Angleton, Tex., in Ernst v. Merck, the first civil case to reach trial among thousands of suits that people who took Vioxx or their families have filed against Merck. In the suit, the wife and children of Robert Ernst contend that Vioxx caused Mr. Ernst to die in bed on May 6, 2001.
