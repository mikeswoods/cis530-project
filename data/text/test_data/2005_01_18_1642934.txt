Last week, I asked for readers' opinions about the fare changes many domestic airlines have made recently, notably reducing the price of first-class seats on many routes. That move, by shrinking the number of first-class seats available for free upgrades, is a potential setback for business travelers who work hard to qualify each year for elite-status levels on particular airlines.
Clearly, frequent business fliers are agitated, but they're far from unanimous in their attitudes. Some elite-status members of frequent-flier programs are unhappy about the imminent decline in the availability of upgrades -- but a fair number of others say they welcome the opportunity to buy a guaranteed first-class seat at a reasonable price.
