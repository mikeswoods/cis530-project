NOTHING can kill Lara Croft. The protagonist of the Tomb Raider games has been impaled, sliced, shot, crushed and burned alive. She has endured cookie-cutter sequels, an ill-conceived makeover and two mediocre Angelina Jolie movies. But she's back, and she's looking good.
For a while, it was not looking good. While the Tomb Raider mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, action and cheesecake was always fun, the games failed to evolve and gamers got bored. A 2003 attempt to revamp the series, Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness, just made things worse, with a collection of poorly executed ideas pulled from popular games that pushed Lara to the edge of irrelevance.
