FAREWELL, FREE FOOD -- A news release put out by American Airlines on Friday cheerfully announced it was starting a ''new food service'' in coach cabins Feb. 1 on ''select domestic routes.'' Missing from the announcement was the fact that the new food service means that all remaining free meals in coach are being eliminated. Instead, American will begin selling meals on all domestic flights longer than three hours, including 120 daily transcontinental flights and 40 flights to Hawaii that were the remaining flights on which coach passengers got free meals. American said the new policy would save it $30 million a year. There will be no charge for meals in first class.
SOARING INTO ASIA -- The world's highest hotel is being planned in Hong Kong by the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company. The company said yesterday that in 2009, it would open a new 300-room Ritz-Carlton to occupy the top 13 floors of a 1,574-foot, 100-story skyscraper being designed by the Kohn Pederson Fox Associates architectural firm in Kowloon. Among the features of the hotel will be windows with panoramic views of Victoria Harbor, the company said. It already operates another hotel, the Ritz-Carlton Hong Kong, across the harbor in the Central District. Ritz-Carlton also said yesterday that it had signed a letter of intent to open a second hotel in the rapidly developing Pudong Lujiazui district of Shanghai. Last week, Sofitel, a top-luxury brand of Accor Hotels and Resorts, said it had won the management contract to operate a new five-star hotel, the 453-room Sofitel Wanda Beijing, which is expected to open in Beijing's central business district in 2006.
