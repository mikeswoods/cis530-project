A Chevron television advertisement broadcast in Russia whimsically pokes fun at Europe's efforts to diversify its sources of energy away from fossil fuels.
A breeze picks up on the streets of Paris, scattering leaves and newspapers and blowing a man's bowler hat down a boulevard in a mighty gust. A voice-over explains: ''As a source of energy wind power alone cannot do it all. Just to power a city like Paris would need 20,000 wind turbines.'' The camera pans up to show the Eiffel Tower converted into a huge lumbering windmill.
