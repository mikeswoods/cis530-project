Awash in cash and practically debt free, Royal Philips Electronics said Thursday that it would buy back up to 750 million euros ($978 million) of its own stock this year and search for acquisition targets even as a previous purchase put a dent in its fourth-quarter earnings.
Philips, the Dutch health care and technology concern, said a 16.7 percent decline in its fourth-quarter profit, to 498 million euros, was a result of a significant write-down of its stake in MedQuist, a medical transcription company that is the subject of class-action lawsuits and investigations by securities regulators.
