Federal prosecutors announced yesterday that Joseph P. Nacchio, the former chief executive of Qwest Communications International, had been indicted on charges of insider trading involving stock sales worth more than $100 million.
The indictment lists 42 counts against Mr. Nacchio involving sales of more than 2.5 million shares of Qwest stock in the first half of 2001. During that time, Mr. Nacchio knew that his company was in danger of missing its financial targets, according to the indictment announced by federal prosecutors in Denver, where Qwest has its headquarters.
