The Genetics Institute said yesterday that it had developed a library of several thousand genes and their related proteins that could be scanned for potential new drugs. The company also said it had entered into agreements with Genentech Inc. and the Chiron Corporation, its longtime rivals in biotechnology, giving them first access to the library.
Under the terms of the deal, Chiron and Genentech, a unit of Roche Holding Inc., will be offered the opportunity to buy thousands of protein samples at modest cost, in return for sharing the development and marketing of any resulting drugs with the Genetics Institute.
