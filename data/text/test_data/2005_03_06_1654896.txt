SOME shareholders of Nortel Networks may prefer to forget the tenure of Frank A. Dunn, who was fired in April as chief executive amid an accounting debacle. Such willful amnesiacs should avoid gazing too intently at BossMan, a new action figure from Happy Worker, a toy company in Toronto. That is because the toy is modeled, ever so slightly, after Mr. Dunn.
''He had the right facial structure and the right suit,'' said Kris Schantz, who founded Happy Worker three years ago with his wife, Shirley Yee. Mr. Dunn, with his sharply defined cheekbones and smooth brow, exudes a certain managerial confidence that Happy Worker was seeking to bestow upon BossMan.
