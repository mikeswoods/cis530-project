While OPEC ministers were being feted by Iran's president on Wednesday with Persian food and Kurdish music, traders in the oil pit of the New York Mercantile Exchange sent them an unexpected message.
Hours after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which was meeting in Isfahan, Iran, decided to increase its production ceiling by half a million barrels a day, prices in New York spiked to a new high. On Thursday, oil futures in New York rose sharply, hitting $57.60 before closing 6 cents below the Wednesday close, at $56.40.
