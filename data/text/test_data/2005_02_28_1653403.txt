In November, CNN named Jonathan Klein, a former CBS executive, as president of its domestic network and charged him with a weighty task: to close the ratings gap with the Fox News Channel, which leads CNN in every prime-time news slot. The network also introduced a quirky new advertising campaign in December, splashing some of its most recognizable on-air personalities, like Anderson Cooper, Wolf Blitzer and Christiane Amanpour, across TV ads that promoted the entire network brand.
So far, the campaign has not benefited CNN in prime time, where Fox still leads, according to data released by Nielsen Media Research. ''Anderson Cooper 360'' failed to make any significant gains on ''The Fox Report'' with Shepard Smith, while ''Paula Zahn Now,'' competing against ''The O'Reilly Factor'' on one side and ''Countdown'' with Keith Olbermann on MSNBC, lost 22 percent of its viewers. Even Larry King's program lost 25 percent of its viewers. The ratings race may be fair, but it certainly is not balanced.
