Adelphia Communications, the beleaguered cable operator, plans to disclose the details of its dealings with the Rigas family, which controls the company, people briefed on the plan said yesterday. The disclosures are aimed at regaining the support of regulators and creditors in an effort to avoid being delisted by Nasdaq, a step that could lead to bankruptcy.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is scheduled to begin taking testimony from the Rigas family early this week. The family is under mounting pressure from a special committee of outside directors, regulators, creditors, Nasdaq and even its own advisers to step down from the board, effectively giving up control, these people said.
