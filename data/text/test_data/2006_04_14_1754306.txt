At many American private equity firms, a Mexican food deal means sending the junior analyst out to buy tacos. At Palladium Equity Partners, it means buying Taco Bueno, the fast-food restaurant chain itself.
Palladium is part of a new breed of private equity firms on the lookout for investments that can tap into the fast-growing Spanish-speaking market in the United States. As the New York area's second-largest minority-owned business behind Goya Foods, the buyout firm is taking advantage of its partners' Latin American heritage and community ties to spot deals that other Wall Street investors may not see.
