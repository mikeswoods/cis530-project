PAIN is a very personal experience, but it soon may be possible for one person to evaluate another's discomfort. Some doctors, scientists and researchers believe there is a pattern to pain that can be rated on a universal scale.
If pain could be reliably evaluated like body temperature, it might be better managed and treated. Health care costs might be reduced; workers would have fewer pain-related absences from work; and fraud from feigned pain might be eliminated.
