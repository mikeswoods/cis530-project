Given the dismal performance of dot-com retailers on Wall Street and in the offices of venture capitalists lately, investors have had their fill of e-books, e-pets, e-drugs and other Web retail operations that burn through cash at Internet speed. What the market seems to be in the mood for now is some old-fashioned e-fficiency.
The problem, according to executives and industry analysts, is that investors had been treating electronic commerce as a popularity contest, giving the sites with the most visitors the highest stock valuations. As a result, many Internet merchants have concentrated more on their Web-traffic figures than on the standard measures of long-term retail success, like gross margins, customer acquisition costs and customer retention rates.
