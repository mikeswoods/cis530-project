In the bistros and bungalows of Hollywood, yesterday's announcement that Michael S. Ovitz would resign from the Walt Disney Company was big news: the climax to a drama that began last year when Disney lured the industry's most feared and powerful talent agent to be its president.
But at Disney itself, news of Mr. Ovitz's departure was received in a remarkably subdued manner. People at the company said they were aware for several months that Mr. Ovitz was chafing under Disney's powerful chairman, Michael D. Eisner. And analysts said his departure would have little affect on the day-to-day business of Disney.
