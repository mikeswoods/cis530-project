General Motors and the United Automobile Workers union said today that they would begin meeting with an arbitrator on Wednesday to resolve the legality of the union's crippling strikes here against the company, as bargaining between the two sides remained deadlocked.
G.M. and U.A.W. officials will meet in Detroit with Thomas Roberts, a 74-year-old arbitrator from California best known for having resolved many baseball salary disputes over the years. U.A.W. officials had supported arbitration but had resisted any quick hearing until a Federal judge, responding to a lawsuit by G.M., asked the two sides here two days ago to move more quickly.
