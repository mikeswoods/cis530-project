At the New York Philharmonic's spring gala last week, a gaggle of retired corporate leaders gathered to honor one of their own, the orchestra's chairman, Paul B. Guenther, who is scheduled to retire this fall. Mr. Guenther, a former president of PaineWebber Group, which was acquired by UBS in 2000, has been chairman of the philharmonic since 1996.
One of the chairmen of the event, Alan Gerry, founder of Cablevision Industries, said that he met Mr. Guenther, who has a home near Mr. Gerry's in Liberty, N.Y., 15 years ago, and that the two had become ''very, very good friends.''
