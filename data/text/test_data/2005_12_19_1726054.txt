The Canadian Medical Association Journal gives readers a mixture of scientific research papers and journalism. Now a dispute about the boundary between the two has led to charges of censorship and the creation of a committee to review the journal's independence.

They, in turn, sent 13 women to buy the pills at pharmacies in each of Canada's provinces and territories.
