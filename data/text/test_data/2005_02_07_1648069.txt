EBay, the online auction site, has altered a recent decision to increase fees.
In a letter posted on its Web site yesterday, Bill Cobb, president of eBay North America, said that the company would reduce certain minimum listing fees by 5 cents, to 25 cents, on its United States and Canadian Web sites.
