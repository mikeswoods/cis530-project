Akzo Nobel announced today that it was forced to delay for at least another year the release of an anti-depressant drug it is testing.
The company said its pharmaceutical division, Organon, was having a hard time recruiting patients for clinical trials of the drug, gepirone ER, formerly called Ariza. Akzo had hoped to release the drug next year for the treatment of severe depression but has now put off plans to do so until at least 2004.
