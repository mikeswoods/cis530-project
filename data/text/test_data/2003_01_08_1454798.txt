A federal judge in New York unsealed internal records of Merck & Company yesterday that detailed favorable treatment that Medco Health Solutions, a Merck unit, gave to some of the company's most important drugs.
The records were unsealed by Judge Charles L. Brieant of Federal District Court in White Plains in connection with a group of long-running class-action lawsuits against Merck and Medco.
