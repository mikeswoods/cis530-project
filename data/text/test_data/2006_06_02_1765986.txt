Consolidation of one of most important industries fueling globalization, steel, may come down to a bitter fight in a tiny corner of Europe: the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, a monarchist state that is gaining notoriety for its involvement in the three-way battle for the steel giant Arcelor.
Some critics contend that Luxembourg's government and regulators have played favorites in the battle for Arcelor, the nation's corporate crown jewel. Arcelor is the largest private employer in Luxembourg, and the monarchy is the largest shareholder. Its actions are helping the company's board fend off a hostile bid from Mittal Steel, over the objections of some of its own shareholders, they say.
