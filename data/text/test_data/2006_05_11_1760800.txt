Camera phones are handy for taking photos, but not so handy for showing them off. Parrot, best known for its car accessories that use Bluetooth wireless technology, has introduced a picture frame that stores and displays photos transmitted from camera phones and other devices via Bluetooth.
The Parrot Photo Viewer is a 3.5-inch L.C.D. screen that comes ensconced in your choice of fashionable frames, from leather grain to distressed wood to faux crocodile.
