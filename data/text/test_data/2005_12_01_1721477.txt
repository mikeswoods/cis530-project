Audits of internal controls at American companies, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, have been both too costly and not as good as they should be, the chief regulator of accounting firms said yesterday.
The report looked at how companies complied with Section 404 of the act, which required the audits. Barely noticed when that law was passed by Congress in 2002, it has become the most contentious section, with companies complaining that the costs of carrying it out have outweighed the benefits.
