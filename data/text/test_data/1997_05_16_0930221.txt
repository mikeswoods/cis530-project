Supported by concrete posts and topped with five lines of barbed wire, the six-foot-high chain-link fence zigzags through the heart of what used to be a blossoming auto-making partnership here. On one side of the fence are the operations of the Ford Motor Company, on the other side those of Volkswagen A.G., now divided by a nasty corporate divorce -- a case study of the difficulties in breaking up a big-company joint venture.
The basic mistake of Ford, its officials now acknowledge, lay in assuming that a marriage made in the late 1980's would last indefinitely. The union looked good on paper: the companies would make cars together for Brazil and Argentina, sharing all the profits and producing no competing models.
