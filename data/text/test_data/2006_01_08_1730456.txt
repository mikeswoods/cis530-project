THE United States stock market finished 2005 close to where it began the year, making it the most conspicuous absentee in a powerful worldwide rally. Double-digit percentage gains were routine in major and minor markets when returns were expressed in dollars, and in several countries, including Japan, Brazil and South Korea, they exceeded 30 percent.
Investors in international equity mutual funds enjoyed an average gain of 17.8 percent in 2005, according to Morningstar, far superior to the 6.8 percent gain of general domestic equity funds. That will be a tough act to follow, although managers of international funds, which invest solely outside the United States, and global funds, which seek opportunities in domestic and foreign markets alike, predicted that investors would continue to find richer pickings abroad this year.
