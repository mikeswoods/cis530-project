The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, the parent of the embattled aircraft maker Airbus, lowered its earnings forecast for 2006 Thursday. It also warned that the financial effect from delays of the new A380 superjumbo jet could be greater than previously estimated.
The parent company, EADS, scrambling to regain investor confidence after the departure early this month of NoÃ«l Forgeard, its French co-chief executive, said it now expected its operating profit for the year to be at the low end of forecasts of 3.2 billion to 3.4 billion euros ($4.07 billion to $4.32 billion). It attributed its reduced expectations primarily to the costs associated with the six-month delay in A380 deliveries announced in mid-June.
