Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, reeling from what it called accounting errors, said yesterday that it would reduce its reported profit for last year and that, at least for now, it was not able to borrow additional money from its banks.
It added that it expected to make further reductions in its past reported profits as an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission continues, and it gave no indication when it expected to file overdue financial statements.
