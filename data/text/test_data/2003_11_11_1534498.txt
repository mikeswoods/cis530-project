For more than a week, the court case between Rosie O'Donnell and Gruner & Jahr USA Publishing has provided drama, tears and a criss-cross of accusations over which side was to blame for the demise of Rosie magazine. But yesterday, those who were enticed to attend by the legal hi-jinks of the past week were treated to a very deliberate tutorial on business accounting.
In an effort to get to the bottom of who breached the contract first, Ms. O'Donnell's lawyers brought in David Williams, a forensic accounting specialist from Deloitte & Touche. The analysis and testimony, which cost Ms. O'Donnell $450,000, suggested that senior executives at Gruner & Jahr had managed the financials in a way to avoid triggering a clause that would have allowed Ms. O'Donnell to walk away from the joint venture with no questions asked.
