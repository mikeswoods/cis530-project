Goldman, Sachs & Company partners voted overwhelmingly yesterday to sell shares in Wall Street's most profitable private investment bank, formally approving an offering plan that values the firm at $28 billion and promises employees a big cut of the riches.
The vote was expected after the decision in principle in June to take Goldman public. But it showed that some of the investment world's savviest underwriters remain confident that the stock market will stay strong enough through the fall to reward Goldman's owners with the lofty premium they expect for their shares.
