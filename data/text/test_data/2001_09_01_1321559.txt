Schroders, a leading pension fund manager in Europe, ousted its chief executive today after big clients moved their accounts elsewhere and first-half profit plummeted by over two thirds. The move appeared unusually abrupt for a company like Schroders, which is family-controlled and likes to project a genteel upper-crust image.
David Salisbury, a 27-year veteran of the company, had been chief executive for only 15 months. He took office after the sale of the Schroders investment banking business to Citigroup for $2.2 billion, when the company wanted to focus on managing assets for big corporations and wealthy individuals. But Schroders failed to keep pace with competitors in a souring market environment, and customers like Bass P.L.C. and Arla Foods have been moving their pension funds elsewhere.
