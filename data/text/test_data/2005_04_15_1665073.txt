Stephen M. Cutler, the top law enforcement official for the Securities and Exchange Commission during one of the agency's most tumultuous times, said yesterday that he would leave in a month.
A successor has not yet been chosen. The leading candidate is Linda Thomsen, 50, Mr. Cutler's current deputy. While Peter Derby, the commission's managing executive for operations, has already solicited suggestions from the five S.E.C. commissioners about who should replace Mr. Cutler, the chairman, William H. Donaldson, will have the final say. If named, Ms. Thomsen would be the first woman to head enforcement at the commission.
