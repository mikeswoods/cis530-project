Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto picked a former prosecutor today to be the nation's new Finance Minister, a surprise choice suggesting there may be further assaults on corruption and clubbiness in Japanese financial circles.
Hikaru Matsunaga, 69, who is chairman of the budget committee in the lower house of Parliament, assumed the top job at the Ministry of Finance in the world's second-largest economy as an outsider. He has little experience in finance or banking, but for many Japanese these days that is an advantage because the system is regarded as so tainted.
