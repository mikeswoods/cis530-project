Lackluster theme park attendance and a poor showing at the summer box office and at the ABC network continued to thwart earnings growth at the Walt Disney Company, which said today that its fiscal third-quarter operating income dropped 26 percent.
The continued drop in theme park business was a surprise to analysts. Many thought attendance was on the upswing, in part because of the prospects of a brighter economy. Operating income at the parks dropped 17 percent, to $467 million. More important, Tom Staggs, Disney's chief financial officer, said that current bookings for the fourth quarter were down 10 percent. ''We wanted to give advance warning of a thing like that,'' Mr. Staggs said in an interview.
