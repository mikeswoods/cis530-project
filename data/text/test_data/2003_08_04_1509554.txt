NOW that investigators are scrutinizing MCI over its reported tactics for avoiding paying network access fees to local telephone companies, some analysts and executives are suggesting that it is also time to look more closely at the access charges themselves.
MCI is accused of disguising long-distance calls as local calls to avoid paying these charges to local phone companies. It is also accused of shunting calls destined for areas with high access costs to some small Canadian phone companies, which then passed them to MCI's biggest rival, AT&T, making it pay the access charges.
