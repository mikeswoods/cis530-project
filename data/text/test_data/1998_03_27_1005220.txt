Who says good works never pay?
Just ask some executives at Minnesota Public Radio, the nation's largest state public radio system. The nonprofit organization's for-profit sister company, the Green spring Company, has announced that it plans to sell its catalogue business to the Dayton Hudson Corporation for an estimated $120 million. Three Greenspring executives, two of whom are also top officers for Minnesota Public Radio, will personally pocket an estimated total of $6.6 million from the deal.
