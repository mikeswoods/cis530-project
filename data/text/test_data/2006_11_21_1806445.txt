Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said yesterday that excessive regulation and burdensome litigation were prompting companies to choose to list their stock on foreign exchanges over American ones.
In a speech in New York on the competitiveness of the United States capital markets, Mr. Paulson said that a wave of revisions to federal laws and regulations after the Enron and WorldCom scandals had improved transparency and accountability at companies and restored investor confidence. But he also suggested that lawmakers and regulators had gone too far and that it was time for a reassessment.
