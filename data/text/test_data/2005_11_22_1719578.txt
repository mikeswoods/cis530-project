The New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, said yesterday that his office was dropping all criminal charges against Paul A. Flynn, a former Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce trader who was accused of aiding illegal trading in mutual funds.
The move, which is rare for prosecutors, comes a month after the attorney general's office decided to drop the remaining four criminal charges against another executive charged in the mutual fund scandal, Theodore C. Sihpol III, a former broker with Bank of America. In July, in an unusual defeat for Mr. Spitzer, a jury in Manhattan acquitted Mr. Sihpol of 29 counts.
