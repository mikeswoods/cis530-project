The Senate rejected a pair of proposals to raise the minimum wage on Monday, one sponsored by a Democrat that would increase the rate by 41 percent over the next two years, and a second offered by a Republican that offered a smaller increase and a number of benefits for small businesses.
The defeat of the wage proposals removed two of the few remaining political obstacles to passage of a measure to overhaul the nation's bankruptcy system.
