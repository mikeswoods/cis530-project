Treasury prices fell yesterday after a strong report on consumer confidence suggested that the economy might not slow as much as expected.
In lighter-than-normal trading volume, the price of the 30-year bond dropped 21/32 , to 102 7/32 . Traders note that price movement is often exaggerated by thin volume. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 5.96 percent from 5.92 percent on Monday.
