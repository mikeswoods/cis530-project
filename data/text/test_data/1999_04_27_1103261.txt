The Ford Motor Company intends to become the world's largest automotive recycler by buying existing recyclers and building its own auto recycling centers to provide used parts, the company announced today.
Ford expects the new subsidiary, which has not been named, to add $1 billion in revenue within a few years by taking apart old cars and trucks and reselling the parts to body shops, insurers and consumers. Company officials did not project profits.
