Nearly 2,000 bogus misconduct complaints against Internal Revenue Service agents were filed as part of a long-running fraud by a group that calls itself a Christian ministry to obstruct the federal income tax laws, the Justice Department said in papers filed yesterday in a court in Florida.
The Justice Department said the false complaints were made to intimidate tax agents. The complaints cited the 1998 I.R.S. Reform and Restructuring Act, which requires the firing of tax agency workers who commit improper acts known as the ''10 deadly sins.'' Some false complaints also asserted that I.R.S. agents had committed crimes.
