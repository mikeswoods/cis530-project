When Bell Atlantic announced its $53 billion agreement to acquire GTE in July 1998, the companies did just about everything but offer free phone calls to convince the world that their deal represented a true merger of equals.
The two local telephone giants appeared to back that up yesterday, announcing a tentative senior executive team that, at least numerically, is drawn equally from Bell Atlantic and GTE. Executives from Bell Atlantic appeared to win the top operational and financial jobs while senior GTE executives will largely control staff functions that have less impact on the combined company's quarter-to-quarter financial results.
