Alice M. Rivlin resigned today as vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, leaving the No. 2 job empty at the central bank as it confronts a tough call on whether to raise interest rates.
Ms. Rivlin, 68, said she was stepping down to do research at the Brookings Institution and to devote more time to her role as head of the District of Columbia's Financial Assistance Authority, which is trying to clean up Washington's finances.
