What marriage has joined together, let the Web help put asunder.
A divorce mediator in Louisville, Ky., has developed a Web-based service that he says will save thousands of dollars in legal fees for couples being divorced. The mediator, Mark Stein, who has been helping the married part ways for 20 years, has started a Web site called ourdivorceagreement.com, which for $149 is meant to help divorcing couples draft their own settlements.
