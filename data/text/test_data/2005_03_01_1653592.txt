Fiat, the beleaguered Italian car maker, said Monday that its fourth-quarter loss shrank by two-thirds, and the company's chief executive pledged that 2004 would be the last year the company would lose money.
Fiat, based here in what was once the heartland of Italian industry, pared its fourth-quarter loss to 374 million euros, or $495 million, from 1.1 billion euros in the final quarter of 2003. Sales were little changed at 12.5 billion euros.
