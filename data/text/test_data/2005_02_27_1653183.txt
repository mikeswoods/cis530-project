INVESTORS who look overseas to reduce the risks of holding stocks can find support in a new study. Contrary to recent objections that this strategy does not work well, if it works at all, the research has found that global portfolios have been significantly less risky over the long run than ones containing domestic stocks alone.
The study, ''International Diversification: Have We Missed the Forest Through the Trees?,'' was written by Clifford Asness, Robert Krail and John Liew, principals at AQR Capital Management in Greenwich, Conn.
