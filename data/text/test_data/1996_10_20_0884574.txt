Markets are amazing things. Sometimes they go up because everyone thinks they will. And sometimes they go up even though no one thinks they will.
It is the oil market that provides clear evidence of the latter point. Almost unnoticed by most investors, oil has been a much better investment this year than stocks. The spot price of oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange is up 32 percent in 1996, while the Dow Jones industrial average has risen just 19 percent.
