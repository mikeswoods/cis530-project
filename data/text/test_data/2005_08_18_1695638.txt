In a reversal of a strategic decision made during a time of management turmoil last spring, Morgan Stanley said yesterday that it would keep its Discover card business and would not seek to spin it off.
John J. Mack, Morgan Stanley's new chief executive, announced the reversal along with plans to overhaul the firm's struggling retail division and sell its airplane leasing business. Three new directors were also named to the company's board.
