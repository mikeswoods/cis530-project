Stock prices tumbled yesterday on intensified fears about world financial instability, which has so badly infected a large American investment fund that the Federal Reserve helped organize a $3.5 billion emergency rescue.
Bank and brokerage shares were pummeled as the Dow Jones industrial average relinquished about two-thirds of Wednesday's big advance to decline 152.42 points, or 1.87 percent, at 8,001.99. Stocks also fell 6 percent in Brazil and by lesser amounts in Europe but advanced in Tokyo following a Japanese holiday.
