Qwest Communications, the smallest of the regional Bell phone companies, is not giving up its efforts to stop Verizon Communications, its bigger rival, from acquiring MCI.
Qwest has requested MCI's shareholder list, according to industry executives briefed on the discussions, in a move that could lead to a protracted, if uphill, proxy battle that Qwest hopes will convince those holding a majority of MCI's shares of the superiority of its bid.
