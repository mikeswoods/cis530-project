An institutional investor advisory service has recommended that shareholders of the troubled Interpublic Group of Companies withhold their votes for three directors who are seeking re-election at the company's annual meeting on Nov. 14.
In a report yesterday, the advisory service, Glass, Lewis & Company, said the recommendation stemmed from the directors' membership on the Interpublic audit committee during the years covered by Interpublic's recent restatement, which reduced earnings by about $514 million. The directors -- Frank J. Borelli, Jill M. Considine and Reginald K. Brack -- are among eight who comprising the slate of board members that Interpublic's management is asking shareholders to re-elect.
