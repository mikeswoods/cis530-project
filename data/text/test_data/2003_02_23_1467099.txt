SINCE the Sept. 11 attacks, one of the most valuable members of Jeffrey L. Wilson's staff at BAE Systems in San Diego has been called up twice to active military duty. The first time was from November 2001 until July 2002. Then, just before Thanksgiving, he was whisked off to a base in Kuwait.
Filling the gaps has been a challenge, says Mr. Wilson, a director of information technology at BAE, the British military contractor. A month before the reservist's departure, Mr. Wilson doled out his responsibilities to his colleagues. Even so, ''there is no way you're going to take everything he knows and distribute it,'' Mr. Wilson said.
