Stocks have been a great investment in the last 80 years, with an average return of about 10 percent a year. But have investors in the stock market done as well as stocks? Surprisingly, the answer is no. The average dollar invested in the stock market in those years has earned only about 8.6 percent a year.
The discrepancy between stock market return and investor return is examined by Ilia D. Dichev, a University of Michigan accounting professor, in a paper  published in the March 2007 edition of The American Economic Review, ''What Are Stock Investors' Actual Historical Returns? Evidence From Dollar-Weighted Returns.''
