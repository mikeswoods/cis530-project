WHEN the Microsoft Corporation snagged a little Silicon Valley start-up called WebTV Networks for $425 million in April, the acquisition was duly noted, but no one seemed to completely understand the attraction.
The company, which sells World Wide Web and E-mail access delivered via television sets rather than desktop computers, had fewer than 100,000 subscribers when the deal was struck.

It was widely assumed that Microsoft was buying little more than patents to a promising technology.
