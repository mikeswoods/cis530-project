Because of a group of law students, the makers of a controversial new energy drink have hit a snag in their attempts to register a federal trademark on Cocaine.
On Dec. 6, the United States Patent and Trademark Office remanded to the examining attorney the application for a federal trademark for the Cocaine energy drink produced by Redux Beverages. Michael Engel, the trademark examining attorney, had tentatively approved the application when he submitted it to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, but changed his mind and asked for a remand for refusal on Oct. 19. The reasons Mr. Engel cited came from a trademark opposition filed on Oct. 10 by five law students at Cleveland State University's College of Law. (Mr. Engel did not respond to messages left on Friday afternoon.)
