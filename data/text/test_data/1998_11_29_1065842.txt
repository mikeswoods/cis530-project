Jim Rogers, the former hedge-fund manager and author of ''Investment Biker'' (but definitely not the Jim Rogers profiled on page 13 of this section), is going for another long drive, this time in an odd-looking yellow car. Mr. Rogers, 56, will drive around the world in a concoction dubbed the Millennium Project that consists of a Mercedes SLK, a two-seater with a retractable top, attached to the chassis of a Mercedes Galaendawagen sport utility vehicle (not widely available in the United States). He will start his three-year journey in Iceland on Jan. 1 to commemorate Leif Ericsson's voyage to North America. Then it's on to Europe, Turkey, Iran, China, South Korea and Japan in 1999; Africa, India and Australia in 2000, and South and North America in 2001. He figures he'll cover 100,000 miles, more than the 65,000 he traveled on a motorcycle in the early 90's.
As the new millennium approaches, he says, ''I want to document the state of the world.'' His fiancee, Paige Parker, 30, will be going along for the ride. The two plan to marry on Jan. 1, 2000. He wants to take the plunge in Timbuktu, Mali, but ''Paige says not on your life.''
