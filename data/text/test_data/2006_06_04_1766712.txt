At 69, he is already past the usual retirement age, but Alan M. Stillman, the founder and longtime chairman and chief executive of the Smith & Wollensky Restaurant Group, could stay on the company's payroll for another 10 years -- unless he dies, although that, too, would have a payoff.
Under a new contract disclosed last week, Mr. Stillman would run the company for five more years at an annual salary of $600,000 and the prospect of a bonus. Then, if his contract is not renewed, he would receive an annual consulting fee of $150,000 for five years. The company also made him the beneficiary of one-fifth of a $5 million insurance policy it holds on his life.
