LIKE many senior-level Internet executives, Christine Harmel, chief executive of Interactive Resource, a firm in Manhattan that matches Web site developers with clients, was present at the birth of e-commerce. Working on the Net since 1995, Ms. Harmel, 32, has experienced years of 80-hour workweeks and has watched the industry transform itself from a stomping ground for young workaholics who wanted to change the world, into a stomping ground for young workaholics who want to change their tax brackets.
Now she is looking to move on. Like a growing number of industry veterans, Ms. Harmel has begun searching for a house away from the nation's technology hotbeds -- South Carolina is her choice -- and is planning to eventually sell her business and leave the industry. ''We're burned out,'' Ms. Harmel said, speaking of Net entrepreneurs of a certain level of experience and fatigue. ''Some of us are tired and rich. Some of us are tired and not rich. But we're all tired.''
