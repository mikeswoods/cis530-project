The Boeing Company and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which Boeing agreed to acquire last month, reported strong fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, but the results fell slightly short of Wall Street analysts' estimates.
One a day the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 94.28 points, Boeing closed at $110.50, down $1.75, on the New York Stock Exchange, after hitting a record $114.50 earlier in the week on news the company would not proceed with plans for a larger version of the 747 jumbo jet. McDonnell lost, $1.125, to $68.875.
