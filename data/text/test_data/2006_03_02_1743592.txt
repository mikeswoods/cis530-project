THE advertising giant that popularized the soap opera, first on radio and then on television, is going online with a multimillion-dollar promotional campaign to stimulate interest in its two remaining shows.
The advertiser is Procter & Gamble, whose sponsorship of daytime serials from ''Ma Perkins'' to ''The Edge of Night'' to ''Another World'' led to their being called soap operas. The sobriquet, from the 1930's, was derived from the soap powders and detergents Procter sold under brand names like Cheer, Dreft, Duz, Ivory Snow, Oxydol and Tide.
