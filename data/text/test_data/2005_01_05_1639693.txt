Securities regulators charged one of the richest men in Mexico, Ricardo B. Salinas Pliego, with fraud yesterday, in a lawsuit that seeks to have him barred as a director or officer of any company whose shares trade on an American exchange.
The Securities and Exchange Commission also sought to have Mr. Salinas Pliego, the chairman of TV Azteca, the second-biggest Spanish-language broadcaster, give up more than $110 million he made from trading in the company's stock and debt.
