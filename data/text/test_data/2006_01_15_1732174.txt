IN the last year, hedge funds and deep-pocketed individual investors have been cajoling management at many large companies to buy back shares, increase dividends or take other steps to bolster shareholder value.
The billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, for example, who amassed a large stake in General Motors, is lobbying for a board seat there. And Carl C. Icahn, the 1980's-era corporate raider turned shareholder activist, has been harrying management at companies like Blockbuster and Kerr-McGee.  Mr. Icahn has directed his wrath most loudly at the media conglomerate Time Warner, which he once said was run by ''morons.''
