With its corporate comeback gaining momentum, Apple Computer Inc. introduced a powerful notebook computer yesterday intended for the consumer market -- a machine that breaks new ground in the personal computer industry for both its industrial design and its use of wireless technology.
The housing of the shell-shaped laptop computer, called iBook, combines translucent white plastic with rubber sheathing in either of two colors -- blue or tangerine orange. In being colorful, the new notebook echoes Apple's popular iMac desktop model, introduced last August, which comes in five colors. And like the iMac, the Apple iBook has been designed to be easy to use and to get access to the Internet.
