Shares of Taser International, the manufacturer of stun guns whose safety has been questioned, rose more than 22 percent yesterday after the company said a newly published scientific study affirmed that the gun's electric shocks do not cause cardiac arrest and ''may be safely applied multiple times if needed.''
The news release issued by Taser quoted directly from the study but did not list the four authors, two of whom are Taser executives. The release also said that the study was published in a prestigious peer-reviewed journal, Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology. But the study is scheduled to appear instead in a supplement to the journal, not the journal itself.
