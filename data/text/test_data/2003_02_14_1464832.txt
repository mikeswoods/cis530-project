The Insurance Services Office, which sets guidelines for insurance pricing across the country, said yesterday that it had agreed on benchmark rates for terrorism coverage in New York and Washington, regarded by the agency as cities at the greatest risk of an attack, along with Chicago and San Francisco.
The company said the rate agreed upon for Manhattan below 59th Street, would be $30 for $100,000 of coverage for nonresidential commercial buildings, less than half the cost of basic fire insurance. Elsewhere in New York City, the benchmark was set at $18 per $100,000 of coverage.
