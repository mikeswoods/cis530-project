The New York Stock Exchange plans to drop a rule that makes it nearly impossible for a company listed on the exchange to move to another market voluntarily, exchange officials said yesterday.
The rule, No. 500 in the exchange's rule book, has long been cited by the Nasdaq stock market in seeking to persuade companies not to move to the Big Board, warning them that if they moved and regretted it, there would be nothing they could do. A Nasdaq spokesman called it the ''Roach Motel'' rule a few years ago.
