Harlem is one of the few places in Manhattan where you can find a 1,000-square-foot two-bedroom apartment with a pear tree in front, a magnolia out back and an oak fireplace in between, all renting for about $2,100.
But it comes at a cost: food. Aside from some renowned soul food, Harlem is relatively underserved in terms of restaurants.
