IN June 1975, a solitary computer hacker slipped quietly into a van in the parking lot of a local hotel, Rickey's Hyatt House, and ''borrowed'' a copy of Microsoft BASIC, the first commercial program from a tiny Albuquerque, N.M., company started by two other young hackers, William H. Gates and Paul G. Allen.
The van was on a nationwide tour to show off the MITS Altair 8800, one of the world's first personal computers. The program -- stored as a set of punched holes in a long paper tape -- was ''liberated'' to be shared by a rag-tag group of Silicon Valley computer hobbyists who that March -- 25 years ago this month -- had banded together as the Homebrew Computer Club.
