NEARLY 100 chief executives applauded mildly when Gene Sperling, the White House economic adviser, finished his pitch for the China trade agreement. Mr. Sperling had been preaching to the choir: no one wants Congress to ratify the agreement more than the nation's top business executives. But their first question to him afterward revealed a concern that, in backing the trade bill, they are stepping on a hornet's nest.
They wanted to know what John L. Sweeney, head of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., would have told them if he, rather than Mr. Sperling, had addressed this gathering of the National Association of Manufacturers in Miami last weekend. Labor unions oppose the bill, which would upgrade China's trade status and open it to more American exports.
