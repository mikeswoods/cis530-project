I AM obsessed with airline timetables. As a kid, I would collect systems timetables from as many airlines as possible, creating fantasy trips, stringing connections from one destination to another in as short a time as possible. My goal was to also create an imaginary trip around the world through exotic places like Istanbul and Calcutta.
As a teenager, I even got to practice my skills when a little-known carrier called Mohawk Airlines offered a systemwide weekend pass for $49, and a friend and I flew on seven different flights, starting in Pittsburgh, and touching down in cities throughout the Northeast. Our goal was to fly as much as possible with as little connection time between flights on our planned itinerary.
