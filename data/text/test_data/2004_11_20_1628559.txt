Michael D. Eisner, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, ended his fifth day on the stand in the shareholder lawsuit where he defended the hiring and firing of the former president, Michael S. Ovitz, once one of Hollywood's most celebrated power brokers.
Mr. Eisner testified on Friday in the lawsuit filed seven years ago on behalf of Disney shareholders who contend that directors breached their fiduciary duty when Mr. Ovitz, a former Hollywood agent, was hired as president in 1995 and then fired 14 months later with a package valued at $140 million.
