DIANA COSTALES, a collector of vintage clothing, loves to describe a find at an estate sale shortly after she moved to Albuquerque seven years ago: five women's suits from the 1940's -- ''some very dressy, some pretty casual,'' she said.
''But what was so amazing about them was they were all perfect, hanging in dry-cleaner bags,'' Ms. Costales added. ''There wasn't a button missing, not a thread pulled, not a stain. It was like time forgot them.'' Hard to forget, however, was the price: just $2 apiece.
