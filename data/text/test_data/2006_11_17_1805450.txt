For bond investors, it is the age of risk. With interest rates low, investors have been willing to take more risk to get higher returns. And by and large, the rewards have seemed to be worth the risks. Defaults have been low, and those who bought junk bonds made more money than those who did not.
Or did they? New research challenges the conventional wisdom, and indicates that buyers of newly issued junk bonds have actually not done very well. The best returns in junk have come from ''fallen angels,'' bonds that began life as investment grade issues but later descended into junk status.
