LONELY singles often dream of playfully chastising a lover for hogging the sheets. Once a couple have moved past the honeymoon phase, however, sheet-stealing can cause acrimony that's anything but good-natured; hell hath no fury like a man or woman who has spent one too many a chilly night.
Sheet competition pushed one of Kevin Robke's relationships to the brink in 1996. ''I had a girlfriend who -- how do I say this in a nice way? -- she stole from me every night,'' said Mr. Robke, of Fort Collins, Colo. ''She liked to roll herself up like a mummy.'' Rather than call it quits, the pair decided to innovate: they stitched together two sheets at the bottom, giving each sleeper much independence. Sheet-stealing ceased to be an issue, and the arguments subsided.
