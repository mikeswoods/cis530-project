Congress keeps taking the ax to the luxury tax it passed in 1991, and the latest swing will gradually eliminate it.
The tax was first levied on private planes, yachts, cars, jewelry and furs. It amounted to 10 percent of the portion of the sales price that exceeded certain thresholds. On cars, it was $30,000. So if a car cost $35,000, the taxable amount was $5,000 and the tax would have been $500.
