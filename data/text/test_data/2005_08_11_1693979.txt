Michael K. Powell, who was the nation's chief regulator of communications at a time when deregulation and new technologies fueled a frenzy of deals in cable, telecommunications and media, is now becoming a deal maker himself.
Mr. Powell, who stepped down as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission in January, is joining Providence Equity Partners, a private equity firm that has in recent years built a $9 billion empire of holdings in media and telecommunications companies.
