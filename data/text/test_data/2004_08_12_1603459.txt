Two former executives of BNP Paribas North America, the New York-based unit of the large French bank, pleaded guilty yesterday to stealing more than $12 million from their employer, in a case brought by Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
The two men, Edward V. Canale and Michael Connolly, who worked in the bank's junk bond trading and distressed real estate operations, set up shell companies that bought securities from BNP Paribas at prices significantly below those in the prevailing market. The securities were later sold at considerable gains.
