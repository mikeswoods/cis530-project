IN a bid to capitalize on the ratings boost it received this year from the hit freshman programs ''Desperate Housewives'' and ''Lost,'' ABC is expected to tell advertisers today that it intends to add six dramas and five comedies to its prime-time lineup during the new television season, according to several people briefed on its plans.
The new programs include one-hour dramas about a female president (''Commander in Chief,'' with Geena Davis) and an alien takeover of a South Florida town (''Invasion'') as well a comedy built around the actor Freddie Prinze Jr. (''Freddie'') and a ''Housewives''-esque sendup of female real estate agents in Manhattan (''Hot Properties'').
