A federal judge in Delaware ruled against the billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian in his lawsuit against DaimlerChrysler on Thursday, picking apart his fraud claims in a ruling that came more than a year after the trial.
In the case, Mr. Kerkorian's investment company, the Tracinda Corporation, claimed that it had been deceived by executives of DaimlerBenz and Chrysler about the nature of the 1998 merger. Executives on both sides of the Atlantic had depicted the combination as a ''merger of equals'' but in the years since, the new company has become dominated by German executives and Chrysler is now run by a former Mercedes executive, Dieter Zetsche.
