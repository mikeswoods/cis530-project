More than 80,000 factory workers went on strike today to protest proposed legislation to cut the workweek from five and a half to five days, but they promised to go back to their jobs after the government said it would postpone action on the bill.
The strike shut down the country's two largest motor vehicle companies, Hyundai Motor and its subsidiary, Kia Motors.
