After a rocky start, the government's accounting oversight board is getting down to the business of policing the nation's most important accounting firms.
In a flurry of major personnel announcements and votes on new rules on Tuesday, the board indicated that it would be ready early next year to begin intensively inspecting many of the auditors of publicly traded companies -- the first time accountants will face systematic examination by a government entity. The largest firms will have annual inspections, while smaller firms will be inspected every three years.
