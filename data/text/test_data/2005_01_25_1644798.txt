Just weeks after losing his world-famous winery, Robert Mondavi is going back into the wine business, briefly, with a surprising partner -- his brother Peter.
It will be a small venture. But it will be the first public collaboration of the two nonagenarians since a legendary dispute some 40 years ago that prompted Robert to split with his family and start his own business. Together, Robert, 92, and Peter, 90, will produce a small barrel of wine -- 60 magnums to be exact -- to be sold next summer at the Napa Valley Auction, the California wine world's premier social event.
