ALMOST seven years ago, when we moved to New York from London and were trying to figure out how to invest our paltry nest egg, I mentioned to a financial adviser that I was interested in putting our money into socially responsible investments.
He looked unimpressed and told me that it was feasible, but that we probably would not get as high a return on our investments. I said I was still interested. And then more or less forgot about the whole thing.
