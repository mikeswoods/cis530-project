Until Tuesday, few people beyond the rarefied world of the government bond market had ever heard of Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., a 57-year-old firm that is an important piece of the backstage machinery of the Treasury market. But in the wake of the attack on the World Trade Center, the firm has emerged as a magnet for Wall Street's concern about the devastation and personal tragedy that the financial community has experienced.
Of Cantor's more than 2,300 employees worldwide, about 1,000 worked at the company's headquarters on the 101st, 103rd, 104th and 105th floors of One World Trade Center, the first tower  hit in Tuesday's attack. Howard W. Lutnick, Cantor's chairman and chief executive, said at a meeting with employees' family members at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan yesterday that only about 270 had been accounted for.
