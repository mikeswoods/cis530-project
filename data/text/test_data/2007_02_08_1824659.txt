The European Commission on Wednesday proposed binding rules that require automakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions for new cars, prompting criticism from European auto companies that said the rules went too far and environmentalists who said the regulations did not go far enough.
Under the proposed rules, which would require approval from the European Union's member countries, carmakers would need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from new cars to an average 130 grams a kilometer by 2012.
