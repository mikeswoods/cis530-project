Kenneth L. Lay sold $100 million in Enron stock last year, the company disclosed yesterday, with a large part of that coming from selling shares back to the company after he was warned by Sherron S. Watkins that the company might collapse ''in a wave of accounting scandals.''
The sales, disclosed in a report filed by Mr. Lay with the Securities and Exchange Commission, included $20 million of shares sold in the three weeks after Ms. Watkins, an Enron official, sent her warning to Mr. Lay.
