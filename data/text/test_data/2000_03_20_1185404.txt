A federal judge has sided with employees of Pan American World Airways in a case related to their pension plan and the way it was administered by a federal agency after the airline went out of business.
The ruling, which eventually may lead to an increase in pension payments for some of the 65,000 people who worked for Pan Am when it went out of business in 1991, affects the way the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation administers pension plans.
