Charles Courtney Seabrook, who with his brothers and father carried out food-freezing experiments in the early days of the frozen food industry, died on Saturday at the Friends Home in Woodstown, N.J. He was 94.
In 1930 Mr. Seabrook, his brothers Belford and John, and their father, Charles F., began experimenting with the freezing of vegetables that they had grown on the family's farm near Bridgeton in southern New Jersey. They simply put the vegetables inside wooden boxes with some dry ice.
