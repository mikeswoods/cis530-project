Cresting a hill on a gravel road at a brisk 20 miles an hour, a driverless, computer-controlled Volkswagen Touareg plunges smartly into a swale. When its laser guidance system spots an overhanging limb, it lurches violently left and right before abruptly swerving off the road.
With their robotic Touareg, known as Stanley, impaled in the brush, the two passengers -- Sebastian Thrun and Michael Montemerlo, both Stanford computer scientists -- pull off their crash helmets and scramble out to untangle the machine.
