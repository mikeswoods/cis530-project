WHEN a Congressional committee in October revealed the many ties between Wall Street firms and their clients, one of its noteworthy findings concerned the Goldman Sachs Group. It had allocated shares from its 1999 initial public offering to William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company. By the next day, the actual number leaked -- 400,000 shares, by far the largest individual award, worth $52 million at its peak and $29.8 million now.
But no one apparently picked up on something even more interesting: John L. Thornton, a president and co-chief operating officer of Goldman, is an old prep-school pal of Mr. Ford's, someone with whom he shares several friends and even more interests. He also serves on Ford's board.
