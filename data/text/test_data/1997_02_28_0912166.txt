THE market gave the 3Com Corporation's proposed $7.3 billion takeover of the U.S. Robotics Corporation a skeptical reception yesterday, sending shares of both companies lower. The skepticism of investors and industry analysts focused on two issues. The deal, they say, does not appear to give 3Com a large new advantage in its battle with the No. 1 computer networking company, Cisco Systems Inc.
For U.S. Robotics, they added, the timing and pricing of the merger seemed odd. The modem maker, they said, could have struck a better deal, since its growth is expected to accelerate because the company has just introduced the the fastest computer modems to date.
