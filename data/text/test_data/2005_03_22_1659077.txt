Like other Big Three auto workers, Deborah Stewart has medical coverage that is, if not a free lunch, then close to it. No deductibles. No monthly premiums. But Ms. Stewart, who works at a sprawling General Motors complex in the shadows of the Detroit skyline, says she believes it cannot last.
''They're losing money, saying they've got to make changes, and I think everybody expects that it's going to come,'' said Ms. Stewart, 55, referring to cuts in health care benefits. A 30-year G.M. veteran who oversees robots that attach fenders to cars, she was heading out after her shift Monday at the Detroit/Hamtramck assembly plant, which produces cars like the Buick LeSabre. ''I think it will come,'' she said, ''without a doubt.''
