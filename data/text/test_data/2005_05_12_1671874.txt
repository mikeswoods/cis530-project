Adding a new twist to the continuing fight over the expensing of employee stock options, Cisco Systems is seeking regulatory approval for a novel financial instrument that could allow the company to assign a lower value to the stock options than under current valuation models.
A lower value for the options, which under new accounting rules will have to be recorded as expenses on Cisco's books starting this July, would reduce the impact expensing will have on Cisco's profits and could lead other companies to adopt something similar. The company said that if it employed a traditional valuation standard like the Black-Scholes model for expensing its stock options, its reported profits would fall by roughly 20 percent.
