Linda Richardson was in her office at Enron one day in February 1999 when her secretary, Marie Thibaut, came in with an open interoffice envelope and a look of concern on her face. ''Linda, are you quitting?'' she asked.
The envelope contained a severance agreement. As Ms. Richardson, a vice president for information technology, looked at the papers, the realization dawned. ''Marie, they're firing me!'' she exclaimed.
