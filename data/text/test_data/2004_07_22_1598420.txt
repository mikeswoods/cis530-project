The Japanese government nearly doubled its forecast for the nation's economic growth to 3.5 percent for the year ending March 2005, the result of a sharp upturn in business investment and increased consumer spending.
The new outlook is in line with forecasts by private economists, and, if achieved, would be Japan's fastest growth since 1997, when the economy expanded 3.6 percent. The cabinet office of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi had previously forecast the economy would grow 1.8 percent in the current fiscal year.
