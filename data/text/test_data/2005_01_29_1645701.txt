After a contest that had pitted domestic pride against global politics, the Pentagon yesterday chose an international team, headed by Lockheed Martin, to build the next fleet of presidential helicopters over Sikorsky Aircraft, which had positioned itself as the ''all-American'' choice.
In selecting Lockheed, which will receive $1.7 billion initially to begin the program, the Pentagon signaled a new openness to foreign partners on sensitive military tasks. By doing so, it also rewarded Britain and Italy, two of the United States' staunchest allies in the Iraq War.
