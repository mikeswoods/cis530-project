Fabian Mira, a 32-year-old father of two daughters, was rushing through Times Square yesterday, clutching three shopping bags full of Barbie dolls and a Power Ranger Ninja Storm (for a nephew). Christmas shopping, he said, had made him sad.
''This year, I am buying, most important, for the kids -- but they wanted too many expensive things,'' said Mr. Mira, who came from Colombia three years ago and works in a dry cleaner. ''Things are harder this year,'' he said.
