BY the time I was 10, my father and sister had died. My mother had to go to work, which was a big deal back then. The other mothers in the neighborhood said I was going to turn into a juvenile delinquent because my mother didn't stay home. I was determined to prove them wrong.
I got my first taste of retail at the department store that my mother managed in Spokane. She took me to work with her after church on Sundays. While she did the payroll in the back, I'd do something like move an entire department from the back of the store to the front.
