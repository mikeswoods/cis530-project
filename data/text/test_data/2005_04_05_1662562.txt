ChevronTexaco said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Unocal, a large independent American oil company, for $16.8 billion, in a move that expands its global reach and could ignite a wave of takeovers of midtier producers.
The transaction, for cash and stock, is the industry's largest in three years, and it gives ChevronTexaco many undeveloped reserves in Azerbaijan, Indonesia and the Gulf of Mexico at a time when oil companies are having trouble finding new prospects. It also ends months of speculation over the future of Unocal.
