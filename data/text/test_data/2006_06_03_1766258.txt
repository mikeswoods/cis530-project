Wal-Mart the Musical opened here Friday, with a cast of two dozen New York actors, hired to play blue-smocked employees, singing and dancing their way through the giant retailer's shareholder meeting with numbers like ''Walk Across the Aisle'' (about buying fashion) and ''The Day That I Met Sam'' (about Wal-Mart's founder, Sam Walton).
The show, a matinee of sorts -- it began at 7 a.m. here, about 20 minutes south of Bentonville, where Wal-Mart is based -- represented a stark departure from previous Wal-Mart's annual meetings, which have generally been long on earnestness and short on irony, and it underscored the growing influence of the new marketing team at Wal-Mart, which put it together.
