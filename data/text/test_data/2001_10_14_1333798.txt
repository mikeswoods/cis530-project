H. Ross Perot, the Texan who founded EDS and Perot Systems, brought the pie charts to Larry King and created a political party wild enough for Jesse Ventura. Now he wants to venture into hedge funds, the Wild West of money management.
Perot Investments, Mr. Perot's private money management arm, plans to open two hedge funds to outside investors, according to a report in Hedge Fund Alert, an industry newsletter. Perot Investments oversees the Petrus Fund, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, and has managed money for Mr. Perot and some of his former partners. But recently the group, based in Dallas, opened a fund for other affluent investors, the report said, and plans a second outside fund as well.
