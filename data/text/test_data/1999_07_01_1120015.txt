Wall Street's core business -- the underwriting of stocks and bonds -- slowed slightly in the second quarter as market interest rates rose.
Securities firms and banks issued $553.1 billion of bonds and stocks, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data, a drop of nearly 11 percent from $620 billion in the second quarter of 1998. It was also down 9 percent from the first quarter of this year. The firms' performances were particulary weak in June, at $157 billion in new issues, the smallest monthly total so far this year.
