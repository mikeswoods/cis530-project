Scott D. Sullivan, the government's star witness in its case against Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, ended seven days of testimony by admitting he broke the law so the company could meet financial targets.
Under questioning, Mr. Sullivan, WorldCom's former chief financial officer, said that he had hid billions of dollars in expenses to mask the company's deteriorating performance.
