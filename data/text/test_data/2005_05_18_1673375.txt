The Russian government outlined on Tuesday how it will gain control of Gazprom, the country's natural gas monopoly. Instead of merging Gazprom with the state-owned oil company Rosneft, as it initially planned, the Kremlin will use a more complicated deal structure.
The government abandoned its merger plans because of fallout from its dismantling of the private oil giant Yukos and the legal assault on the founder of Yukos, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky.
