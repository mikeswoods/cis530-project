In a deal that brings together Britain's largest suppliers of electricity and natural gas, the National Grid Group is expected to announce on Monday that it has agreed to acquire the Lattice Group, which owns Britain's gas pipelines, for about $9 billion in stock and the assumption of $9 billion in debt, executives close to the talks said today.
The companies plan an announcement before the markets open here on Monday morning, they said.
