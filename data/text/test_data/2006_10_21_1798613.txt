The shadow of billions of dollars in asbestos and other claims that has hung over Lloyd's of London for nearly two decades finally lifted yesterday. And the man who pulled it off is one of the richest and savviest businessmen in the world, Warren E. Buffett.
Mr. Buffett agreed to pay up to $7 billion in claims for insurance that Lloyd's sold dating as far back as the 1920's and 30's. The claims at one point had threatened to ruin thousands of Lloyd's investors who had pledged their entire net worth to back up coverage.
