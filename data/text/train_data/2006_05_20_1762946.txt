Mittal Steel made a last-minute effort to seal the industry's largest merger ever on Friday, sharply increasing its bid for Arcelor by a third, to 25.8 billion euros ($32.9 billion), and making a crucial pledge to cede family control if a deal is cemented.
The founder and chief executive of Mittal, Lakshmi N. Mittal, unexpectedly announced the increased bid a day after an offer for Arcelor was officially tendered to shareholders. The move was aimed at wooing Arcelor management into friendly talks, after a period of wrangling that at one point turned into a corporate clash of civilizations.
