Edward M. Gramlich, one of two Democrats on the Federal Reserve Board, said on Wednesday that he would resign at the end of August.
Mr. Gramlich, who is 65, joined the Fed in 1997. He said he would become a professor at the University of Michigan and had plans to write books on the economics of airlines and on low-income housing.
