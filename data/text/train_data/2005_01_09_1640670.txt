KITSON LOGUE describes Mustela putorius furo, better known as the domestic ferret, as ''a funny little guy.'' Its penchant for swiping unattended keys certainly qualifies as odd, as does its persistent musky scents, which can be lessened through regular ear-wax removal. But it is the ferret's unusual appetite that most intrigues Dr. Logue, a veterinarian who is vice president for research and development at Kaytee Products, a pet food manufacturer based in Chilton, Wis.
Unlike other mammals that are commonly lumped into the pet food industry's ''small animals'' category, ferrets have a palate more akin to a tiger's than a gerbil's. ''He's a true carnivore,'' Dr. Logue said. ''He needs a very high level of protein to help him digest.'' So in formulating the company's latest ferret treat, Kaytee's Ferret Banana Yogurt Dips, Dr. Logue had to ensure that the absence of meat would not mean an absence of taste and nutrition.
