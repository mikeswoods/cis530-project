A federal judge here dismissed on Thursday night an effort by the Russian oil company Yukos to seek bankruptcy protection in the United States, thwarting its hope of putting some American legal hurdles in front of the international banks involved in the Russian government's breakup of the company.
The ruling may set an important precedent for financially troubled foreign companies seeking haven in bankruptcy courts in the United States, one of the few nations where executives of debtor companies are normally allowed to retain control after filing for bankruptcy protection.
