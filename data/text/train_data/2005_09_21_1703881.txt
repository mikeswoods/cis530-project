The Interpublic Group of Companies in New York said yesterday that it would place a shareholder proposal to sell the company on the proxy for the 2005 annual meeting, after the Securities and Exchange Commission denied a request by the company to exclude the plan.
The proposal was submitted by an owner of 300 shares of Interpublic stock, Charles Miller, who has placed similar proposals on the proxies of other companies in which he owns shares. In a statement, Interpublic said that it believed that the ''best current course of action'' to maximize shareholder value ''continues to be resolving financial reporting issues and improving operating performance.''
