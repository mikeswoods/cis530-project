The Justice Department's antitrust division announced yesterday that it had approved Whirlpool's purchase of its smaller rival Maytag, a $1.7 billion deal that will create one of the largest home appliance companies in the world.
Despite the dominant market share the merged companies would have, government lawyers concluded that the deal was not likely to reduce competition among home appliance manufacturers substantially, in part because of strong domestic rivals like General Electric and Frigidaire as well as rivals from abroad including LG, Samsung and Bosch.
