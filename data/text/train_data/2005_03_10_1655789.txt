Four foreign banks that helped WorldCom sell bonds the year before it filed for bankruptcy agreed yesterday to pay $428 million to settle with investors, bringing the total payout in the case to $3.56 billion, a record in a securities class action.
The banks that agreed to settle with Alan G. Hevesi, the comptroller of New York and trustee of the state's Common Retirement Fund, are ABN Amro, Mitsubishi Securities, Mizuho International and the BNP Paribas Securities Corporation. All were relatively small participants in a WorldCom bond deal in May 2001; together, they sold 12 percent of the $12 billion offering.
