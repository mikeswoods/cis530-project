Saudi women may not be allowed to vote or to drive, but Islamic law does grant them the right to control their finances. A few years ago, Saudi banks started opening social branches for women, with separate entrances, distinct product offerings and all-female staffs. But the business of ''ladies' banking,'' as it is known in Saudi Arabia, had remained relatively low key.
But this week, Banque Saudi Fransi plans to start an advertising campaign that breaks with this tradition, promoting women's banking to a mainstream consumer audience. A 40-second television commercial shows a Saudi woman, wearing a hijab, in a variety of settings -- in a business meeting with other women, working at a computer, at her wedding and playing with her children.
