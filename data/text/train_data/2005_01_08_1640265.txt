The Supreme Court announced on Friday that it would review the criminal conviction that drove Arthur Andersen, the once-prominent accounting firm, out of business.
Over the objections of the Justice Department, the court will consider whether Andersen's prosecution for obstruction of justice -- growing out of its extensive shredding of documents related to its major client, Enron -- was a proper application of the federal witness-tampering statute, which the firm was charged with violating.
