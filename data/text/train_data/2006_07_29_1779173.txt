In an abrupt move yesterday, Pfizer named its general counsel, Jeffrey B. Kindler, as chief executive, succeeding Henry A. McKinnell, who had been expected to resign in February 2008.
The move comes amid signs of management turmoil at Pfizer, where three senior executives have been vying for more than a year to succeed Mr. McKinnell as chairman and chief executive. In the last few months, analysts and people in the industry said, Pfizer's board has grown increasingly concerned about Mr. McKinnell's autocratic management style and the company's struggles to bring new drugs to market.
