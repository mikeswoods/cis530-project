Record companies often issue collections of the B-sides and soundtrack contributions of popular acts; Rhino Entertainment, a division of Warner Music Group, is once again faced with a band whose regular albums never sold very well. This time, it will release the rarities online only.
Rhino, which releases catalog material from various Warner labels, plans to announce today that it will release a collection of cover songs by the band Luna that will be sold only at online music stores. In addition, on June 20, the label will release a Luna greatest hits collection as well as a DVD documentary about the band's final tour, which will be sold in traditional stores.
