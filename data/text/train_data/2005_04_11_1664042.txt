Oprah Winfrey is thanking her 2.6 million readers for their loyalty with a treat. In May, along with the fifth anniversary issue of O, The Oprah Magazine, will come a book of Ms. Winfrey's wit and wisdom, sponsored by Dove soap.
The book, which will be given free to the magazine's subscribers and its nearly one million newsstand readers, cost between $1 million and $2 million to produce and was published in-house by the magazine, which is a co-venture of Hearst Magazines and Harpo Print.
