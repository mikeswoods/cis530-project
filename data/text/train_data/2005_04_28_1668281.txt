JONATHAN Swift is credited with affixing the label ''bubble'' to a stock price that far exceeded its economic value in a poem written in December 1720, just after the stock price of the South Sea Company tumbled. The last stanza read: ''The Nation too, too late will find/ Computing all their Cost and Trouble/ Directors Promises but Wind/ South Sea at best a mighty Bubble.''
Perhaps it is a tad late, but economists are rediscovering bubbles.
