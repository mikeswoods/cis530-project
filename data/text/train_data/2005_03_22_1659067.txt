Goldman Sachs said yesterday that it was strengthening its investment in wind energy with the acquisition of Zilkha Renewable Energy, one of the nation's largest developers of wind projects. The deal comes after several similar transactions since the start of the year, signaling robust commercial interest in wind-powered electricity generation.
The companies did not disclose the price or terms of the acquisition, but the deal would give Goldman Sachs control of almost 4,000 megawatts of wind-energy projects under development in 12 states.
