Criminal investigators at the Food and Drug Administration have apparently become involved in the agency's inquiry into how the Guidant Corporation handled problems with its heart devices, said two people contacted by the investigators.
Since June, the F.D.A. has been looking into several issues involving Guidant, including whether it properly reported failures of some of its heart devices and manufacturing changes to correct the problems. The agency's Office of Criminal Investigations is often called upon to examine such issues.
