Ann Fudge, who has led Young & Rubicam Brands and its struggling advertising agency, Young & Rubicam, since May 2003, will cede control of the agency as soon as a successor is found but will remain in charge of Y.&R. Brands, the agency said.
Ms. Fudge, chairwoman and chief executive of both Y.&R. and Y.&R. Brands, has faced pressure as the advertising agency lost clients like Burger King, Computer Associates International, the Jaguar division of Ford Motor and Sony Electronics. There has been widespread speculation for several weeks that the WPP Group, the parent of Y.&R. Brands, had begun a search for an executive to assume duties at the agency.
