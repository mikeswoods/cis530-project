DECADES ago, back-to-school shoppers heard commercials featuring a choir warbling a jingle that began, ''School bells ring and children sing, 'It's back to Robert Hall again.'''
Now, the retailer Kmart is seeking to stimulate back-to-school sales with tunes like ''At Auntie Tom's'' by Fuzz Townshend and ''Here It Goes Again'' by OK Go -- not to mention a commercial in which boys ogle the denim-clad derri√®re of a female classmate.
