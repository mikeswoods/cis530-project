Noranda, the largest Canadian mining company, announced on Wednesday that it would acquire the 41 percent of the nickel producer Falconbridge Ltd. that it does not already own, in a stock swap worth 3 billion Canadian dollars, or $2.49 billion.
At the same time, Noranda, based in Toronto, said it had ended unpopular negotiations to be acquired by China Minmetals, which is owned by the Beijing government. In September, China Minmetals offered to buy Noranda for about $4.7 billion.
