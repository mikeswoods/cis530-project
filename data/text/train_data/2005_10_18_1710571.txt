As Wall Street had expected, results of a clinical trial reported yesterday showed that the Endeavor stent from Medtronic was inferior to the Cypher device from Johnson & Johnson at preventing the growth of scar tissue within the stent.
Stents are used to prop open heart arteries after blockages have been cleared. Endeavor and Cypher are part of a new generation of stents that are coated with drugs to reduce the tendency of scar tissue to grow so aggressively that blood flow is seriously impaired.
