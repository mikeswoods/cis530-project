More than two dozen advertisers are buying commercials tomorrow night during Super Bowl XL on ABC. The network is charging a record price, estimated at $2.5 million for each 30 seconds; some spots will run for 15, 45 or 60 seconds. Several advertisers bought time in the last few days, including American Honda Motor, for the Ridgeline truck; GoDaddy, the Web site registrar; and Starwood, for Westin hotels. Here is a look at the lineup of commercials that are planned to appear nationally during the game; the schedule is subject to changes at the last minute based on factors like the flow of the game.
