Workers at a landfill in Orange County, Calif. -- as if tamping down the contents of a wastebasket -- regularly pile one million cubic yards of dirt atop a football field-size section of the giant dump. Six months later, the workers scrape the dirt aside and the dump's surface has fallen 30 to 40 feet, making space for yet more trash.
''It's just amazing,'' said Mike Giancola, deputy director of the county's waste agency.
