WHEN my husband went shopping for a memory card for our digital camera, he looked at several and was finally swayed by one offering a $20 rebate.
He carefully filled out a card with all the details needed for the rebate, sent in the packaging code and the original receipt, and after a few months forgot all about it. He has never received the money or a notice explaining why he didn't get it -- and he is less than eager to chase after such a small amount.
