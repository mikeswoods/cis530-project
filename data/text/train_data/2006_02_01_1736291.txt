Mellon Financial named a top Wachovia banker its chief executive yesterday, ending months of criticism from activist investors who called for a change in leadership and strategy.
Robert P. Kelly, Wachovia's chief financial officer, will become Mellon's chairman and chief executive on Feb. 13. He will succeed Martin G. McGuinn, who reshaped the company from a slow-growing regional bank to an asset management giant.
