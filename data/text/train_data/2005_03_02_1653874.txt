The Brazilian economy expanded in 2004 at its fastest pace in a decade, with booming exports and a sharp increase in consumer spending helping it rebound from three years of meager growth.
The government statistics agency said Tuesday that the gross domestic product increased 5.2 percent last year, the best performance since 1994, when Brazil adopted a new currency, the real, to curb rampant inflation. In 2003, the economy, South America's largest, expanded by just 0.54 percent.
