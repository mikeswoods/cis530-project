The H.J. Heinz Company is close to a Â£470 million ($861.3 million) deal to buy HP Foods, the British condiment company, from Groupe Danone, according to three executives close to the negotiations.
The all-cash deal is expected to be announced here on Monday morning, these executives said. Heinz already has a sizable presence in Britain, where it employs about 5,000 people. The company, which is based in Pittsburgh, has been focusing on its ketchup and condiment lines.
