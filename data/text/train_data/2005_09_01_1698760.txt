THE troubled Interpublic Group of Companies was dealt a serious blow yesterday when one of its largest clients, the Bank of America Corporation, dismissed Interpublic and shifted its consolidated account, with total spending estimated at $600 million, to the Omnicom Group.
The account shift is one of the largest in advertising in recent years. The Interpublic agencies that will be losing their assignments have worked for Bank of America -- the nation's No.2 bank behind Citibank -- since late 2002. The assignments accounted for $60 million to $65 million of the estimated $6.2 billion in revenue for Interpublic, the world's third-largest agency holding company behind Omnicom and the WPP Group.
