Hartmut Meine's office here overlooks an old graveyard. It is a fitting view for a man who is waging a twilight battle to keep his 114-year-old labor union viable, as global competition threatens to undo half a century of rights and privileges won by millions of German workers.
In the last month, Mr. Meine's union, IG Metall, has reached three wage deals with Volkswagen. In each case, VW demanded -- and won -- significant concessions, partly by threatening to move the production of one car to Portugal, where hourly wages are less than a third of those in Germany.
