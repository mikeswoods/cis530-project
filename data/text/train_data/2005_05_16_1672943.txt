For Ruth Blatt, there's nothing better than having clothes that can do double duty. ''I like doing yoga, training with my personal trainer and spinning,'' said Ms. Blatt, a mother, doctoral candidate and fitness buff, in a recent visit to a fitness studio, Vie Fitness and Spa, in Ann Arbor, Mich.
But Ms. Blatt, 31, likes to combine those workouts with seeing her friends or working at her local coffee shop. And she doesn't always want to change her clothes. ''I don't want to be seen wearing an old torn sweatshirt that should be out of circulation. I want to look nice.''
