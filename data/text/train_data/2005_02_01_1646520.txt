Pulitzer Inc., the publisher of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, The Arizona Daily Star and 12 other daily newspapers in the Midwest and West, has agreed to be acquired by Lee Enterprises, a newspaper chain based in Davenport, Iowa, for nearly $1.5 billion.
The deal joins two like-minded companies. Lee's 44 daily newspapers stretch from Glens Falls, N.Y.,(where it publishes The Post-Star) to Oceanside, Calif., (The North County Times), but are largely clustered in the Midwest. The company publishes The Wisconsin State Journal and The Capital Times in Madison, Wis., and The Sioux City Journal in Sioux City, Iowa.
