The Ford Motor Company said on Tuesday that it expected operating earnings to fall as much as 14 percent this year as record profits at its lending division are weighed down by rising interest rates. Ford also expects a weak first quarter that will be far short of Wall Street's expectations.
But executives are forecasting sharply higher profits for the core business of manufacturing and selling cars and trucks. And they said they still expected pretax profit of $7 billion in 2006, the central goal of a turnaround plan put in place after steep losses and a management shakeup in 2001.
