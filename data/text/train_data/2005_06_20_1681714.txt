The Bank of Communications, China's fifth largest, priced its shares on Saturday for an initial public offering at 2.50 Hong Kong dollars (32 cents), near the top end of a range of 1.95 Hong Kong dollars to 2.55 Hong Kong dollars. The offering will raise at least 14.6 billion Hong Kong dollars ($1.88 billion) and as much as 16.9 billion Hong Kong dollars ($2.17 billion) if a 15 percent overallotment option is later exercised, Goldman Sachs said.
The range had been widely viewed as relatively low when it was announced on June 6.
