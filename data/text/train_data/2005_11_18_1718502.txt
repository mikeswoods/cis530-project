Google became a verb before it became a public company. Now it has also become a $400 stock.
Just 15 months after the company went public in an unusual auction at $85 a share, which was less than the company had hoped and was widely viewed as disappointing, Google traded yesterday above $400 for the first time, closing at $403.45, up $5.30. The gain helped lift the Nasdaq composite index, which rose 1.5 percent, to 2,220.46, to its highest close since June 2001.
