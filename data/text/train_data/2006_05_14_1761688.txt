AMONG the most arresting scenes produced in advance of the current season of the drama ''24'' is one that has not been seen by viewers who watch the show on the Fox network. It is a car chase through an industrial neighborhood in Chicago featuring the series' main character, played by Kiefer Sutherland.
Last fall, executives for Fox Broadcasting -- which, like 20th Century Fox Television, the producer of ''24,'' is a unit of the News Corporation -- had asked the studio if they could broadcast that 10-minute scene as a ''prequel,'' before the fifth-season premiere of the series in January. The network was politely, but flatly, turned down.
