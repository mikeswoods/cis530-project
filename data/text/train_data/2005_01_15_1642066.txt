Gene S. Kahn, the chairman and chief executive of May Department Stores, resigned under pressure yesterday, six months after he led a $3.2 billion purchase of the Marshall Field's chain.
A search to fill the position will begin immediately, according to a company news release, and will encompass ''both internal and external candidates.''
