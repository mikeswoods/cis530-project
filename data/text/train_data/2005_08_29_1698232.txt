A FEW weeks ago on ''Entourage,'' HBO's series about a rising Hollywood star named Vince Chase and the posse of former Queens buddies he runs with, the plot involved a media antagonist conspiring to complicate his career. So who would don the villain's mustache and threaten Vince's starring role in an ''Aquaman'' movie? Perhaps a reporter or columnist from Variety, The Hollywood Reporter or Entertainment Weekly?
Nah. It was some geek named R.J. whose comics Web site gets a million hits a day.
