Layoffs have disrupted the lives of millions of Americans over the last 25 years. The cure that these displaced workers are offered -- retraining and more education -- is heralded as a sure path to new and better-paying careers.

It is adapted from ''The Disposable American: Layoffs and Their Consequences'' by Louis Uchitelle, an economics writer for The New York Times. Knopf will publish the book on Tuesday.
