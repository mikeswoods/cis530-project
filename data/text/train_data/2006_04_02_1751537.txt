IT has been a rough first inning for Andrew E. Friedman, the cherubic-faced 29-year-old general manager of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Opening day looms, and one of his best young pitchers has been lit up for four runs while his third baseman has booted one ball and overthrown another. Business as usual, it would seem, for the bumbling Devil Rays, long a doormat for the powerful big-budget teams in the American League East.
Just over two years ago, Mr. Friedman was a junior banker toiling for an obscure private equity firm in New Jersey. Now, perched on the edge of his seat behind home plate at a spring training game here in St. Petersburg, his poker face intact, he is scanning his BlackBerry for trade offers and checking pitch counts.
