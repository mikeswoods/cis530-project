Lexus drivers reported the fewest problems with their new vehicles, while owners of cars like Volvos, Porsches and Saabs on average had much more to complain about, according to the latest survey from J.D. Power & Associates. The study also found that owners were significantly more impressed with their Nissans and Hummers after giving the brands dismal ratings in last year's survey.
Lexus, which is owned by Toyota, led the J.D. Power study for the fifth year in a row. Lexus was followed by Jaguar, owned by Ford, and BMW, which took the third spot. The worst performers in the study were Land Rover and Mazda, both owned by Ford, and Suzuki.
