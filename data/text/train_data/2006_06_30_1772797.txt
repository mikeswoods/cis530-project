The directors of Michaels Stores, the nation's largest arts and crafts retailer, are expected to meet today to consider two takeover bids that could value the company at about $6 billion, people involved in the bidding process said last night.
Michaels, which put itself up for auction in March, has received bids from two consortiums of private equity investors: one group includes Bain Capital, the Blackstone Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners; and the other comprises Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and the Texas Pacific Group, these people said.
