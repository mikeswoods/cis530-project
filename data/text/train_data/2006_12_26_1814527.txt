It was Andrea Illy's grandfather, Francesco Illy, who back in the 1930s invented the espresso, a steam-driven coffee maker to replace the little pots Italians used until then.
So it is not surprising that Mr. Illy, who now runs the coffee company Illycaff√®, sought in recent years to have the name espresso protected by law, so that it could be used only by Italian espresso makers. It was a gambit to take back the espresso heritage.
