MAJOR institutional investors are up in arms over the way MCI has conducted itself in finding a buyer. Its board so far has backed the lower bid from the company that can best afford it, Verizon, rather than the higher bid from Qwest, a company that is, to put it gently, financially challenged.
''The question is not whether Verizon is a larger, more financially sound company that possesses assets, such as wireless, that Qwest lacks,'' Bill Miller, the chief investment officer at Legg Mason, wrote in an angry letter to MCI. ''It is and it does. The question is which transaction creates the most value for MCI owners.''
