Bristol-Myers Squibb, the pharmaceutical company, is in talks with several suitors to sell its Excedrin line of pain relievers and other over-the-counter drugs for as much as $1 billion, executives close to the negotiations said yesterday.
A sale of Bristol-Myers Squibb's consumer medicines unit, which consists mainly of Excedrin-branded products like Excedrin Migraine and Excedrin PM, would be the latest move by the company to dispose of noncore product lines as it tries to focus on its drugs to prevent and treat diseases, a field it hopes will offer a higher return. The unit for sale also includes Bufferin; Comtrex, a cold and flu medicine; and Keri lotions.
