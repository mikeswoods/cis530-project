JOE HANSON, 22, of Chicago likes to watch television, but rarely on his TV. A folder on his computer lists an inventory of downloaded cable and network programming -- the kind of thing that makes traditional media executives shudder.
''I've got 'Ali G,' 'Arrested Development,' 'Scrubs,' 'The Sopranos,' '' Mr. Hanson told a visitor recently at his apartment on the city's Southwest Side. '' 'South Park,' 'The Office,' some 'Family Guy.' ''
