A lead defense lawyer in the fraud trial of two former Enron executives tried on Thursday to portray the government's most effective witness so far as a greedy manager with a selective memory who had been carefully scripted by prosecutors.
In cross-examination, the defense lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, elicited testimony from the witness, Paula H. Rieker, that she had made millions of dollars at Enron and refused to leave the company even when she felt she was witnessing potentially criminal activity among top managers. And she conceded that while she witnessed acts involving top managers that she viewed as wrong, she did not consider them crimes.
