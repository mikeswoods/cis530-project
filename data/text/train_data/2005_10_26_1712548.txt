Amazon.com, the online retail company, reported yesterday that its profit declined in the third quarter, partly as a result of a legal settlement, while sales of the latest Harry Potter book helped increase revenue by 27 percent.
The company's net income fell some 44 percent in the period, to $30 million, or 7 cents a share, compared with $54.1 million, or 13 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 27 percent, to $1.86 billion, from $1.46 billion a year earlier, and were largely in line with forecasts. Excluding the effects of the legal settlement of $40 million, earnings would have been $50 million, or 12 cents a share, the company said, 2 cents more than analysts forecast.
