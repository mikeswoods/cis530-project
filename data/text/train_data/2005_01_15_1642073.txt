A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended against the over-the-counter sale of a Merck cholesterol-lowering drug, saying that while millions of Americans could benefit from taking it, they should not begin such a regimen without a doctor's advice.
The F.D.A. typically heeds such recommendations, meaning that the drug industry has been at least temporarily thwarted from creating a new segment of the drug market. But Merck and its partner in the application, Johnson & Johnson, said they would continue trying to win approval.
