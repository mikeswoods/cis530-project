Mexican regulators fined Ricardo B. Salinas Pliego, chairman of the TV Azteca network, one of his top lieutenants and the network itself a total of $2.3 million, saying they violated securities law, the company said Thursday.
In addition, people in the Mexican government close to the investigation said regulators here have asked the attorney general to file criminal charges against Mr. Salinas Pliego, accusing him of unlawful use of privileged information. The charges carry a prison term of two to seven years. The fines follow Securities and Exchange Commission charges of fraud filed against Mr. Salinas Pliego in January.
