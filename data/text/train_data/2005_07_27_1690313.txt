General Motors said Tuesday that it would sell up to $55 billion worth of consumer car loans to Bank of America over the next five years.
The move follows downgrades in May of G.M.'s debt to a rating of below investment grade, or junk, by Standard & Poor's and Fitch. Those downgrades and rising interest rates have made it more expensive for G.M.'s financing division, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, to use bonds to raise money for car loans. But G.M.A.C., as the financing division is known, does have more palatable options available, like selling off large numbers of car loans in a relatively new kind of transaction known as a whole loan sale.
