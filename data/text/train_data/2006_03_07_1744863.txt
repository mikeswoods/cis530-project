CROWDED FLIGHTS -- Planes are more crowded than ever on domestic routes, even as fares continue inching up, and the monthly traffic data explain why. American Airlines said its domestic capacity, or the number of seats available, dropped 3.5 percent, while domestic revenue passenger miles -- defined as one paying passenger flown one mile -- rose 2.2 percent. Delta Air Lines, which is operating in bankruptcy protection, reported a 17.6 percent drop in domestic capacity against a 12 percent drop in revenue passenger miles. (On the other hand, Delta reported a 22.4 percent jump in capacity on Latin American routes, reflecting its push into more lucrative markets.) Northwest Airlines, also operating in bankruptcy, reported a 7.6 percent drop in domestic seats against a 6.5 percent decline in revenue miles flown. Continental Airlines reported 4.9 percent more domestic seats but a rise of 11.3 percent in revenue miles flown. United Airlines, newly emerged from bankruptcy, had 3.5 percent more domestic seats available in February, against a 6.7 percent rise in revenue miles flown. Southwest Airlines' capacity increased 8.5 percent, but its passenger revenue miles jumped 17.3 percent.
MANHATTAN HOTEL BOOM -- In another indication of booming times for hotels in the Big Apple, the London-based luxury hotel company Millennium & Copthorne reported a virtual sellout -- 87 percent average daily occupancy -- at its three Manhattan hotels in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with 60.1 percent at the rest of its United States hotels and 72.3 percent worldwide in that period. The average room rate for the three New York hotels -- the Millennium Broadway, the Millennium Hilton and the Millennium United Nations Plaza -- was $275.12. The Millennium Hilton is owned by Millennium & Copthorne, but operated by Hilton Hotels.
