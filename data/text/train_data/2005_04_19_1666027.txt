Six years ago, I flew to Texas with one of our sales managers to meet the executive chef of Hooters. I had only been with StockPot for six months. Everything was going swimmingly.
We were all nodding and smiling, and I was feeling extremely proud of myself. Then I made the mistake of asking the chef if there was anything else she wanted to know. She asked if our soups began with a base or a stock and I answered that we used a base.
