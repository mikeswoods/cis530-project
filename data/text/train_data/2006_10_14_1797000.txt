A giant stuffed SpongeBob SquarePants is perched against the window of Cyma Zarghami's corner office at Nickelodeon Television overlooking the Hudson River, its blue eyes staring out and puffy arms drooped by its side.
The stuffed icon in the president's office is an appropriately oversize reminder of just how important SpongeBob has been to Nickelodeon, the children's network that was started by Viacom in 1979.
