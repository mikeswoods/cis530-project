Profit at Honda Motor fell 3.1 percent in the latest quarter on derivatives losses, but sales rose in all its major markets and the company raised its profit outlook for the financial year.
Honda, the third-largest automaker in Japan, said net profit slipped to 111 billion yen ($1.02 billion) in the three months through June. The drop was largely a result of losses in financial derivatives Honda had bought to hedge against currency risk.
