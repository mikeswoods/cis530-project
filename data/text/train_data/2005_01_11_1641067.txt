President Bush said last month that for his personal health coverage he was choosing a new option, a health savings account. But most people are wary of these accounts because they do not want to risk having to spend more on their medical bills, according to a survey to be published today.
Health savings accounts, which combine low monthly premiums with a requirement that individuals pay out of pocket for the first $1,000 of health costs each year, were introduced last year under a provision of the 2003 Medicare law. But only a handful of employers have begun to offer the accounts, and very few employees have chosen them.
