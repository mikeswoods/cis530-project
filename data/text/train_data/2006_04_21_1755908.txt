The Federal Communications Commission intensified its investigation this week into accusations of pay-for-play practices at four of the nation's biggest radio station owners after settlement talks collapsed, agency officials said yesterday.
F.C.C. investigators issued requests for documents from the four companies -- Clear Channel Communications, CBS Radio, Citadel Broadcasting and Entercom Communications, agency officials said. The F.C.C.'s enforcement unit is looking into accusations that broadcasters violated the law by accepting cash or other compensation in exchange for airplay of specific songs without telling listeners.
