TNK-BP, the Russian oil company, showed stockholders on Friday its long-awaited plan to begin melding its more than a dozen subsidiaries into one overarching company. The plan set TNK-BP's value at no less than $18.5 billion.
Shareholders in TNK-BP, the British-Russian joint venture that is powering BP's growth, have been anxiously awaiting details of the restructuring. They will have a choice of swapping their shares for new stock in the umbrella company, or being bought out.
