Theodore J. Forstmann, the financier who has said that he will not raise a new last investment fund, made what was likely to be his last big bet yesterday by acquiring a private fitness company for $1.6 billion.
Mr. Forstmann's firm, Forstmann Little & Company, has agreed to buy 24 Hour Fitness Worldwide, the world's largest privately owned chain of fitness centers, executives with both companies said. The deal is expected to be announced today. The chain, based in San Ramon, Calif., has 345 clubs in 15 states with 2.8 million members, mostly on the West Coast, and another 15 clubs in Asia. Last year, the company had more than $1 billion in revenue.
