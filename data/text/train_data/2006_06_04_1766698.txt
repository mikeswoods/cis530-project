''ART consists of limitation,'' G. K. Chesterton said. ''The most beautiful part of every picture is the frame.'' Well put, although the buyer of the latest multimillion-dollar Picasso may not agree.
But there are pictures -- whether sketches on paper or oils on canvas -- that may look like nothing but scratch marks or listless piles of paint when you bring them home from the auction house or dealer. But with the addition of the perfect frame, these works of art may glow or gleam or rustle or whatever their makers intended them to do.
