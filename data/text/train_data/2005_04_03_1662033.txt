WHEN Vance D. Coffman retired as chief executive of Lockheed Martin last August, the company wanted to show a little gratitude. So the board endowed a $1.5 million professorship at Iowa State University, Mr. Coffman's alma mater, to honor his steady leadership over 37 years. It also agreed to foot the bill for various expenses, like his country club membership and use of company aircraft, until he steps down as chairman this month at the age of 61.
Those perks, however, are pocket change compared with the pension that Lockheed, the military contractor, bestowed upon Mr. Coffman a few weeks ago: a $31.5 million lump-sum payment.
