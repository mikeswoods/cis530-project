Senior officials of the Bush administration told a Senate panel on Tuesday that the nation's companies should use ''mark to market'' values, or numbers that more closely reflect current market values, for their pension funds. Their remarks drew criticism from both business and labor representatives who testified.
Mark Warshawsky, the assistant Treasury secretary for economic policy, told the Senate Finance Committee that pension funding rules were inaccurate, permitting companies to shortchange their pension plans and mask their weaknesses. These practices, he said, jeopardize the benefits of millions of workers and undermine the finances of the federal agency that insures them.
