The chairman of CBS, Leslie Moonves, announced yesterday that he had canceled the Wednesday edition of ''60 Minutes,'' a six-year-old spinoff of the Sunday evening staple.
The most visible result of Mr. Moonves's decision is the reassignment of Dan Rather, a full-time correspondent on the weekday edition of ''60 Minutes,'' to the Sunday program. Mr. Rather, whose contract does not expire until late 2006, said yesterday that his transition to the new job would begin immediately.
