Fannie Mae's main regulator sued the company's former chairman and chief executive, Franklin D. Raines, and two top financial officers yesterday in an effort to extract more than $215 million in bonus payouts and fines over their involvement in a huge-scale accounting scandal.
The regulator, the Office of Federal Housing and Enterprise Oversight, is seeking about $100 million in penalties. But its effort to recoup more than $115 million in bonus payments is notable for its rarity and size.
