Russian stocks, buoyed by high oil prices and a surge of foreign investment, have been soaring. After an 83 percent gain in the RTS stock index last year -- the best stock market performance outside the Middle East in 2005 -- the index is up nearly 33 percent so far this year.
That market boom has multiplied the already apparent signs of wealth in the Russian capital. A Lamborghini dealership has opened. Airline travel has picked up. A trade fair for companies aimed at millionaire customers came to Moscow.
