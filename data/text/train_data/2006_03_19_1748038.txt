I GREW up in Steyr, a medieval Austrian town that now has a population of about 40,000. It has a beautiful marketplace, and it's at the junction of two rivers that flow in from the mountains.
We had an engineering college in Steyr, and as a boy I was already interested in dismantling things. I took my mother's watch apart, and I took a little motorbike of my grandmother's apart when I was 14, so I was trying to understand how these systems work.
