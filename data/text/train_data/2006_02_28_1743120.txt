CLASS CONSCIOUS -- United Airlines said that it was planning to put a new emphasis on its premium-class cabins domestically and internationally, while cutting spending on economy-class customers.
''We are judiciously taking money and investing it in the high-value customer and at the same time we are not spending any more than we have to on the low-value customer,'' Frederic F. Brace, United's chief financial officer, said last week in a speech to industry analysts sponsored by J. P. Morgan.
