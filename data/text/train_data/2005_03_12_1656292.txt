Qwest Communications International Inc. is expected to raise its $8 billion bid for MCI Inc. next week in an attempt to break up MCI's deal with Verizon Communications Inc., according to people close to the situation.
The new offer would come after MCI spurned Qwest's bid last month and opted to sign a deal with Verizon for $6.75 billion, or 16 percent less. To assuage angry shareholders, MCI agreed to reopen talks with Qwest.
