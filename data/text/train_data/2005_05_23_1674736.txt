The development of a permanent successor to Dan Rather on the ''CBS Evening News'' has been shrouded in secrecy, but a meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of the network's parent company, Viacom, suggests that CBS is canvassing opinions from people well outside the news division.
One of the six attendees was Terry Wood, who developed the ''Dr. Phil'' talk show and ''The Insider,'' a celebrity news program, and who now supervises those programs as an executive at Paramount Television and King World Productions, both Viacom divisions. Ms. Wood, in a high-profile flourish of corporate synergy, was responsible for the recent CBS prime-time special in which Dr. Phil (Phillip McGraw) interviewed Pat O'Brien, the host of ''The Insider,'' about his treatment for substance abuse. She is a close associate of Leslie Moonves, the chairman of CBS.
