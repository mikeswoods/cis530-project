Ivan Luini, who, as founder and president of the New York-based Kartell U.S. Inc., helped bring plastic furniture out of the garden and into the American living room, died on Friday in a small-plane crash in Moffat County, Colo., near the Wyoming border. Mr. Luini was 46 and lived in New York City and Sag Harbor, N.Y. Sergio Savarese also died in the crash.
Mr. Luini and Mr. Savarese, avid pilots and good friends, were killed in the crash of a Cirrus SR20, a four-seat, single-engine aircraft that they co-owned and were flying cross-country on a business trip to visit stores, family members said.
