Responding to the accounting scandals at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the House of Representatives approved legislation on Wednesday overhauling the regulatory oversight of the two huge mortgage financing companies.
The legislation, approved by a lopsided vote of 331 to 90, would create a new regulator for the Federal Home Loan Banks and for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, companies formally known as government-sponsored enterprises. The new agency, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, would be financed through assessments on the banks and companies. It would have the authority to set capital requirements, reject new business products being offered by the companies and limit their portfolio holdings.
