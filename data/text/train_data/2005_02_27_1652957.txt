Evidence of robust economic growth helped the stock market to recover from a midweek slump caused by rising oil prices. The Commerce Department on Friday revised its gauge of the pace of economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2004, bumping it up to an annual rate of 3.8 percent from its estimate of 3.1 percent in January. Analysts had expected a revision to just 3.7 percent.
Oil stocks led the market's rally, driven by Exxon Mobil, which rose 6.5 percent for the week. ConocoPhillips climbed 5.7 percent.
