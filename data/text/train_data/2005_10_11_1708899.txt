Building oil rigs is providing export-dependent Singapore with an unexpectedly strong source of economic growth even as it struggles to hang on to its traditional niche in electronics amid rising competition from China.
Its Ministry of Trade and Industry said Monday that Singapore's economy appeared to have expanded 3.2 percent in the third quarter, according to preliminary estimates based on two months of data. Economists said that put the country on track to beat government projections for growth this year of 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent.
