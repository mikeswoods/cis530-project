A landmark agreement by former WorldCom directors to pay millions of their own money to settle with investors was revived yesterday about six weeks after it was scuttled by objections from other defendants in the case.
Under the terms of the settlement, which was reached early yesterday evening, 11 former WorldCom directors will pay $20 million out of their own pockets to settle with Alan G. Hevesi, comptroller of New York and trustee of the state's Common Retirement Fund. Mr. Hevesi is lead plaintiff in the civil suit representing hundreds of thousands of investors who held WorldCom stock and bonds in the years immediately before its bankruptcy filing in 2002.
