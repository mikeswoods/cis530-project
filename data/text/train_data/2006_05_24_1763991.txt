The world's largest chip maker, Intel, said Tuesday that it would introduce a low-cost computer in India, one of the world's fastest-growing technology markets, in an effort to gain greater market share.
Intel announced the Indian computer project as part of a wider global strategy to promote the use of technology in emerging markets. The computer will have a processor, chip set and software designed by Intel and will be produced by Indian hardware makers.
