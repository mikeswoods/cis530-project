Bernard J. Ebbers, the former WorldCom chief executive accused of securities fraud, testified yesterday that he had no idea his deputies were hiding billions of dollars in expenses from 2000 to 2002.
Referring to expenses that were hidden to inflate the company's earnings, David Anders, an assistant United States attorney, asked Mr. Ebbers: ''WorldCom reduced its line costs through adjustments of more than $2 billion, and you had no idea?''
