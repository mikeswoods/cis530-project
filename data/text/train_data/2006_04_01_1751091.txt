MDS, a Canadian drug and medical testing company, suspended operations at its Montreal laboratory on Friday after another unfavorable audit from the United States Food and Drug Administration.
The laboratory conducts tests for generic drug makers to show regulators that their products produce the same results as brand name pharmaceuticals. The F.D.A. audits the Canadian lab because its findings are presented for drug approvals in the United States.
