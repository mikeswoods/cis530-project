Research In Motion, maker of the popular BlackBerry messaging device, settled a three-year-old patent dispute Wednesday by agreeing to pay $450 million to NTP, a company that holds a patent on a primitive form of wireless e-mail.
In exchange for the one-time payment, NTP will give Research In Motion ''an unfettered right to continue its BlackBerry-related wireless business without further interference from NTP or its patents,'' R.I.M. said in a statement. The case was being appealed in Virginia.
