Antitrust investigators at the Justice Department have begun examining a proposed acquisition by the Gannett Company, the country's largest newspaper publisher, as the industry appears headed for further consolidation this year.
In a separate case, the department has also received a letter from The Boston Herald contending that a planned investment by The New York Times Company in Boston Metro, a free daily newspaper mainly for commuters, would violate antitrust law and hurt advertisers and readers.
