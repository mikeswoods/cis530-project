In 1960, when Harry Macklowe started his career as a leasing broker with Julian Studley's tenant representation company, his office was in an oddly shaped, masonry-clad, 1920's-vintage building on Madison Avenue between 43rd and 44th Streets.
Because there had been two holdouts when the land for the structure was being assembled, the building was constructed with thin fingerlike sections between and alongside the holdout properties. In the days before air-conditioning this was not a completely bad thing, since windows on both sides of the narrow sections provided cross ventilation.
