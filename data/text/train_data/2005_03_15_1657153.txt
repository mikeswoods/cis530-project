Bartolo Mascarello, a Barolo winemaker whose enduring adherence to traditional practices in the face of changing fashions made him a symbol of staunch loyalty, died Saturday at his home in the town of Barolo, Italy. He was 78.
The cause was cardiac arrest, said his daughter, Maria-TÃ©resa. She said Mr. Mascarello had had heart problems for many years.
