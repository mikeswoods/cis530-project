Heart doctors at the Cleveland Clinic, one of the nation's largest centers for cardiac care, have voted unanimously to severely curtail or even ban the clinic's use of the Johnson & Johnson drug Natrecor.
The final decision is in the hands of a clinic committee that is expected to review data at a meeting today. Natrecor, widely used as a treatment for heart failure, has been reported in two recent medical journal studies to increase kidney problems and death rates among patients. Last week, the company worked out a plan with federal drug regulators to cite such risks on its label.
