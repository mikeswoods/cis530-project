Growing up on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Timothy E. Brog had no idea baseball cards had better uses than flipping.
But in the late 1970's, not yet a teenager, he bought a box of about 6,000 baseball cards, including a mint-condition 1967 card of shortstop Maury Wills, for about $90, he said. His father was not pleased, and was surprised when Mr. Brog later sold the collection for several thousand dollars.
