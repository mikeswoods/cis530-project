The Registered Traveler program, which promises to help frequent fliers pass through airport security faster if they pay an annual membership fee and undergo a background check, has been pulled aside for a secondary inspection before its scheduled introduction next month.
Many corporate travel managers -- who will be approving the expenses of the travelers most likely to join the program -- say they remain concerned about crucial issues. The program is expected to start expanding next month beyond Orlando, the only airport where it is currently operating, to as many as 20 other airports by the end of the year.
