This weekend, Maria Bland says she will be driving around in a pristine Ford F-150 truck, picking up her dryer and dishwasher from the repair store and enjoying a smooth ride in Miami's sunny weather.
She will also be saving on her gasoline bill: Ms. Bland, a secretarial assistant at a technical high school, is renting the truck for the weekend rather than drive her 13-year old GMC pickup, which gets much poorer mileage. Ms. Bland, who has been renting regularly as gasoline prices have risen, said, ''Sometimes, nothing will do like a rental.''
