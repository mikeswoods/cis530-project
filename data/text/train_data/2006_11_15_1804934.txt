O. J. Simpson, who was acquitted 11 years ago in the 1994 death of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald L. Goldman has written a book and will appear on television telling ''how he would have committed the murders if he were the one responsible,'' his publisher and the Fox television network said on Tuesday.
Judith Regan, whose publishing imprint ReganBooks will release Mr. Simpson's book Nov. 30, also conducted the television interviews, which will be broadcast on Fox in two one-hour segments on Nov. 27 and Nov. 29. Both ReganBooks and Fox are owned by the News Corporation.
