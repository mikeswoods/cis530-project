The chairman of the Hyundai Motor Company, South Korea's largest carmaker and a symbol of the nation's economic rise, was charged Tuesday with embezzling more than $100 million and causing far larger financial damage to companies under his control.
The chairman, Chung Mong Koo, 68, was charged with misappropriating 130 billion won ($136 million) to set up a slush fund that was apparently used to buy political influence, Chae Dong Wook, a senior prosecutor at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office, told reporters. He said Mr. Chung was also charged with breach of trust, accused of causing more than 400 billion won ($429 million) in damages to companies in the Hyundai group.
