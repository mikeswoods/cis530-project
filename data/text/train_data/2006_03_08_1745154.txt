VNU, the Dutch publishing and market research company that owns ACNielsen, was near a deal late last night to be sold to a consortium of private equity investors for about $9 billion in cash, according to people involved in the discussions.
The company is hoping to announce the transaction this morning when it is also planning to report its earnings, these people said.
