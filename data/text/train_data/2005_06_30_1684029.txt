In a sweeping change to its management structure, UBS, the giant Swiss bank, is expected to announce today that Huw Jenkins, the global head of equities, will succeed John P. Costas as chief executive of its global investment banking unit, people briefed on details of the plan said yesterday.
Mr. Costas, who has overseen the Swiss-based bank through a period of rapid growth and significant market share gains in the United States, will head a hedge fund within the global asset management group to focus initially on trading various types of debt securities.
