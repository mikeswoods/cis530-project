A LAVISH theatrical version of ''The Lord of the Rings,'' which opened last month in Toronto, has been savaged by critics who say it has insipid dialogue and campy songs. True devotees of the fantasy trilogy, however, may be judging the spectacle on different criteria. Sticklers for accuracy, they will have opinions that depend largely on how faithful each prop and costume is to the original story; woe to the show if the aficionados decide that Gandalf's beard isn't quite long enough.
Kit Rae is well versed in such ''Lord of the Rings'' nitpicking. As a product designer at United Cutlery of Sevierville, Tenn., Mr. Rae was in charge of developing a line of souvenir weapons inspired by Peter Jackson's film version of the trilogy. For one of those products, a pair of Elvish weapons known as the Fighting Knives of Legolas, he selected a yellowish hue for the handles. The online protests were legion, as many fans insisted that the handles should be white.
