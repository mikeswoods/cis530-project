Citigroup, the world's largest financial services company, said yesterday that first-quarter earnings rose 3.2 percent on higher growth in its consumer banking, helping to offset other businesses like asset management that were weaker.
The company also announced plans to buy back as much as $15 billion in shares over the next 18 months. Citigroup earned $5.44 billion, or $1.04 a share, compared with $5.27 billion, or $1.01 a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 6 percent, to $21.5 billion.
