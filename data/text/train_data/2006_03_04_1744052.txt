YOU never know what's going to set someone off. Consider the case of Michael Mayo, who runs the financial services research team for the Prudential Equity Group.
Mr. Mayo, 42, is one of the few Wall Street analysts who is willing to put sell recommendations on stocks when he thinks it is warranted. Starting in the spring of 2005, he had a sell rating on J. P. Morgan Chase. But in early January, Mr. Mayo upgraded that to hold, and on Jan. 31, he went all the way to buy.
