Until this summer, the Kaierlai Sports Goods Company in Shishi, China, depended heavily on exports of its windbreakers to Germany.
But when the European Union reimposed import quotas and abruptly halted the shipments this summer, Kaierlai did not miss a beat. It stepped up sales of windbreakers within China so quickly that not only did it not lay off any of its 1,000 workers this autumn, it will hire another 1,000 when a second factory opens next year.
