When the American Bar Association sought a site for the president's reception during its annual meeting a few years ago, it chose the Tower of London, the palace and fortress for every British monarch from William the Conqueror in the 11th century to Henry VIII in the 16th.
The 3,000 lawyers and their guests dined outdoors on the Tower grounds and were entertained by the Band of Her Majesty's Welsh Guard, minstrels in Stuart-era costume performing on period instruments, and costumed singers of Tudor music. The lawyers and their spouses were also treated to private tours of the palace and viewings of the Crown Jewels, not to mention a demonstration of swordplay by knights in 15th-century armor.
