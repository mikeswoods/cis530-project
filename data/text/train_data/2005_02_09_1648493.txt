On this sprawling Army base about 40 miles southwest of Savannah, most of the lawns are brown in winter and the housing tends to be drab and decades old. But Jessica Gustavson and her two children are about to get their own patch of newly sodded grass along with a new three-bedroom home that would not seem out of place in a comfortable suburb.
Part of a fourplex, the two-story house includes a master bathroom with a double sink, a powder room, huge closets, an attic, a covered patio and an up-to-date U-shaped kitchen. Large windows let in plenty of light, a feature that Mrs. Gustavson, 32, said was particularly welcome now that her husband, a sergeant, has left for Iraq for the second time.
