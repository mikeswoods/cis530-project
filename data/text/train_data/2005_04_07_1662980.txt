The Scholastic Corporation announced yesterday that Barbara A. Marcus, who built its children's book business into an industry powerhouse, was leaving and would be succeeded by Lisa Holton, the publisher of the children's books division at the Walt Disney Company.
But a spokesman for Disney's consumer product division, Gary Foster, said last night that Disney was surprised by Ms. Holton's appointment at the rival publishing house, because she ''has not been released from her employment agreement.''
