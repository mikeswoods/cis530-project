The Halliburton Company signaled on Tuesday that an investigation by the Justice Department into bribery charges related to its dealings in Nigeria had broadened to encompass whether its executives had rigged contracts with competing companies in an effort to profit illicitly from large foreign construction projects.
Halliburton, the energy services company, revealed the widened investigation in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is also conducting an inquiry into payments made in connection with a natural gas complex in Nigeria. The inquiries have already led to the firing last year of Albert Jack Stanley, the former chairman of Halliburton's KBR subsidiary.
