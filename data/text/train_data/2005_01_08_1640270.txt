The Royal Dutch/Shell Group said on Friday that Judith Boynton, who was demoted as chief financial officer last year after a sharp write-down in oil reserve estimates, left the company last week with a $1 million severance package.
Ms. Boynton, who had stayed at Shell to work on special projects, left to pursue other opportunities, the company said. Her severance was paid as stipulated in her employment contract, but she will receive no bonus for 2004, or performance-related payments for 2003 or 2004, Shell said. She will, however, receive Â£1.32 million ($2.47 million) in pension, shares and options this year.
