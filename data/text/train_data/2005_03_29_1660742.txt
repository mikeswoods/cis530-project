On Palm Sunday, Kay Severs attended an Easter party, complete with an egg hunt and a visit from the Easter Bunny. She did not celebrate with relatives and friends, however, but with a mismatched group of business executives, athletes, nurses and other adults from all parts of the United States.
Ms. Severs, a traveling nurse from Bradenton, Fla., is a long-term guest at the Oakwood Marina Del Rey, an extended-stay hotel that is within walking distance of Venice Beach, Calif. ''It beats hanging out alone in your room,'' she said about the party. Since she checked into the property on Jan. 20 to work a stint in the emergency room of a local hospital, she has attended a number of such events, mingling with other guests at hotel-sponsored events ranging from bingo parties to Oscar night celebrations to Wednesday evening cooking classes.
