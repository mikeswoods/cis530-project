The advertising agency that created the character of the lonely Maytag repairman is about to become lonely, too, as the new owner of Maytag appliances moves the account to another agency.
Leo Burnett in Chicago, which has produced Maytag campaigns since 1955, is losing the assignment as the Whirlpool Corporation, which acquired the Maytag Corporation in March, consolidates accounts at its own agency. So the Maytag brand, along with three other appliance brands, Amana and Jenn-Air, are leaving Burnett for Publicis Worldwide in New York, which creates ads for the Whirlpool brand of appliances in North America.
