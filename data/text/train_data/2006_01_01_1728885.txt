I ALWAYS wanted to be a journalist and cover sports. After an uninspiring high school athletic career I knew my best hope to make it in the sports world was through journalism. However, I was always a details kind of guy. I liked organizing and putting things together: keeping journals or planning outings or just pulling together a group to play ball after school or on weekends.
When I was a teenager, a group of my friends from East Meadow, Long Island, my hometown, and I would go into New York to see a Knicks or a Rangers game or just to spend the day. I was always the one who got the tickets, pulled together the train schedule and recommended where to eat.
