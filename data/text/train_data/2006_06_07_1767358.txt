While struggling to find the right mixture of merchandise, Gap significantly ratcheted down its advertising in the last six months -- effectively telling shoppers to take a stroll around the block while its stores got their act together. Now the company, the nation's largest specialty clothing retailer, is ready to invite consumers back inside.
Beginning in July, as Gap prepares to introduce its fall clothing line, the Gap brand will resume advertising on television, again use celebrities in its print marketing and, for the first time, change store window displays once a month rather than once a season.
