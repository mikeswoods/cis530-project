Not long ago, Pamela Henning, an executive at a New York-based film company, listened to her music over an expensive stereo system loaded with 2,000 of her favorite CD's. But, she said recently, it was a bit too much to handle. She bought a five-CD changer, later replaced with a single-CD player. Eventually, she chucked it all.
''I found the old-world technology so time-consuming,'' said Ms. Henning, senior vice president for integrated marketing for the Weinstein Company.
