AS the holiday shopping season begins, Madison Avenue is paying tribute to a movie that has become a perennial for the generations that grew up after popular Christmas films like ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and ''Miracle on 34th Street.''
The movie is ''A Christmas Story,'' in which the humorist Jean Shepherd offers a rueful look back at his boyhood, circa 1940. The film presents the comic misadventures of Ralphie Parker, whose most fervent wish -- nay, obsession -- is to receive an ''official Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot range model air rifle'' as a Christmas gift from his parents.
