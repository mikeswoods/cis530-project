The board of Goldman Sachs yesterday elected Lloyd C. Blankfein, the firm's president and chief operating officer, to succeed Henry M. Paulson Jr. as chairman and chief executive.
Mr. Blankfein, 51, will assume both jobs, if Mr. Paulson, who was nominated by President Bush to be Treasury Secretary on Tuesday, is confirmed by the Senate. Mr. Paulson will stay on until then.
