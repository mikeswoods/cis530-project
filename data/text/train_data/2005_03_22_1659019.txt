The pharmaceutical makers Novartis and Schering said Monday they would delay seeking regulatory approval in the United States and Europe for their experimental colon-cancer drug PTK/ZK after mixed trial results.
The delay was a blow to Schering, which was relying on PTK/ZK to bolster its earnings, and has few drugs in development, analysts said. Schering's stock plunged 14.2 percent, to 50.06 euros, or $66.66, in response to the news. But the shares of Genentech and Roche Holding rallied, as their drug Avastin, which works in a similar way, will apparently remain unchallenged for a time.
