Two partners at a prominent securities class-action law firm have taken leaves of absence in the latest twist of a federal investigation into accusations that illegal tactics were used in shareholder lawsuits.
According to the statement released last night by the law firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman, the two lawyers, David J. Bershad and Steven G. Schulman, have left the firm in order to prepare defenses for their possible indictments.
