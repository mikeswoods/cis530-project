A federal judge has indefinitely postponed the trial of former employees of the accounting firm KPMG in a criminal tax shelter case, citing concerns that the defendants will not be able to pay their lawyers.
The judge also hinted at sanctions against the prosecution for pressuring the firm to stop paying the defendants' legal fees. Any sanctions could have a major impact on the way white-collar criminal cases are handled in the future.
