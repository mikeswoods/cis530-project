KEITH FERRAZZI did not enjoy Valentine's Day this year. He and his boyfriend of two years had just split up, and for the first time since he was 21, Mr. Ferrazzi, 39, would spend Valentine's Day alone.
But hard as the day was, Mr. Ferrazzi knows it could have been a lot worse. At work, at least, he could escape from the melancholy.
