Beginning today, the World Business section and the daily stock market tables will be combined into the main Business Day section. The Times will make its daily financial listings more concise by condensing some tables and eliminating secondary ones. The shift is a response to the increasing cost of newsprint and the growing use of listings online. It permits the consolidation of each day's entire business news report and statistics in a single section.
The tables for the Nasdaq small-capitalization market, preferred stocks and foreign stocks are being eliminated, as are the tables for active bond issues, stock exchange bond trading, trading in agency and zero-coupon bonds, cash prices for commodities and daily gold prices. The daily futures table will include prices for the active near-month contract only. A table for trading in corporate bonds will be added.
