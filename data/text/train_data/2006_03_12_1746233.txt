I GREW up in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. My parents, who left Germany in 1936 to escape the Nazi regime, owned a retail store. Working there as a kid gave me an early feel for business. At 10 or 11, I joined a youth movement similar to the Boy and Girl Scouts.
I learned people skills from this group. As a teenager, I became a group leader and organized a three-day summer camp for 30 or 40 kids.
