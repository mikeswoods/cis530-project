Cyndi Stivers, the founding editor in chief of Time Out New York, said yesterday that she was stepping down as president and editorial director to join Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia as an executive vice president, effective May 18.
The move reunites Ms. Stivers, 48, with Susan Lyne, the president and chief executive at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia; Ms. Stivers worked for Ms. Lyne at Premiere magazine. Alison Tocci, 47, publisher at Time Out New York, will succeed Ms. Stivers as president and group publisher.
