MARC LEVINE opened a closet in the living room of his Manhattan apartment to reveal two unframed drawings. Then he laughed about a recently purchased photograph -- still in bubble packaging -- that he had lent to the neighbors. He has no wall space left for these works; his apartment is already covered floor to ceiling with photographs, prints and paintings.
Mr. Levine, 38, who owns Model Bartenders Inc., an event staffing company, has collected more than 40 works of art, from a $15,000 sculpture by Robert Graham that he won with a $100 raffle ticket to dozens of smaller prints and photographs for which he paid only a few hundred dollars each, often at charity art auctions. ''I love art, and I collect on an emotional level,'' Mr. Levine said. ''It's something that I can put on my wall and enjoy. And what better way to collect art than to support charities.''
