Matsushita Electric Industrial, the world's largest consumer electronics maker, reported Friday that profit jumped 47 percent in the latest quarter on healthy demand for its flat-panel TV's and DVD recorders.
Matsushita, the maker of Panasonic products, reported a better-than-expected net profit of 35.57 billion yen ($342 million), for the three months ended Dec. 31. Revenue rose 13 percent, to 2.3 trillion yen ($22 billion), as strong sales of digital cameras, plasma televisions and DVD recorders more than offset dwindling sales of VCR's and stereos.
