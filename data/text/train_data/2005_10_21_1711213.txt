In a widely expected move, Warner Brothers Entertainment said yesterday that it would produce high-definition DVD's in the Blu-ray format championed by Sony in addition to the standard being promoted by Toshiba and a rival group.
The move by Warner, a unit of Time Warner, comes nearly three weeks after Paramount Pictures made a similar announcement. Universal Studios, the third studio that agreed to make movies in Toshiba's format, is expected to follow.
