The Russian billionaire Aleksei Mordashov changed the terms Tuesday under which he would buy a big stake in the European steel giant Arcelor, in an effort to salvage a deal that is facing increasing opposition from shareholders.
Mr. Mordashov said he was now planning to lower the size of the stake he aimed to acquire in Arcelor to 25 percent, down from as much as 38 percent, the level at which he struck a deal with the company last month. He also said he would no longer seek to lead a strategic management committee that would give him some control over Arcelor's long-term future.
