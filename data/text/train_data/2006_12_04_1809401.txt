This just in from the Heartclog Hotel: To commemorate the 30th anniversary of Elvis Presley's death, the Hershey Company, the nation's largest candy maker, is planning to introduce a limited edition, peanut-butter-and-banana-creme Reese's cup.
Featuring a dashing picture of a young and svelte Elvis on the front of the package, the Reese's Elvis Cup, as it will be called, will land on store shelves next July, in plenty of time for Elvis Week in August. The week draws thousands of visitors to Memphis for events that include music, parades and a candlelight vigil.
