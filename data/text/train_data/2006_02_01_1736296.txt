Angiotech Pharmaceuticals agreed yesterday to acquire the privately held American Medical Instruments Holdings, a maker of custom needles, for $785 million in cash, the company said.
The deal, which is expected to be formally announced today, would transform Angiotech, a pharmaceutical company that specializes in medical device implants, surgical interventions and acute injury or trauma, into a diversified medical services business. Angiotech is a partner, for example, with Boston Scientific on the Taxus stent.
