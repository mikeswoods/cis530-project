THERE is no need to worry much yet about the stock market's stumble this year.
Such inauspicious beginnings have happened before and haven't always signaled major problems. While there were 19 other years since 1945 in which the market declined in the first five trading days, in only 9 of those years did the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index wind up down for a full 52 weeks.
