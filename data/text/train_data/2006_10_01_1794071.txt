WHAT if the initials H.P. -- as in Hewlett-Packard -- enter the lexicon in the same manner that Google has? Google, of course, has become much more than a corporate name. It now doubles as a catch-all term for online search that has resulted in nifty little verbs like ''Googled,'' ''Googles'' and ''Googling.''
If H.P. undergoes the same sort of metamorphosis and becomes shorthand for illicit snooping, you might be telling your friends that a stalking ex-boyfriend is ''so H.P.'' or that your office mate, who snoops through the stuff on your desk and listens a little too closely to your calls, has ''gone H.P.''
