An investment firm run by a prominent Democratic fund-raiser is near a deal to take a minority stake in Pathmark, the Northeast supermarket chain, for about $200 million, people close to the deal said last night.
The investment by the Yucaipa Companies, a Los Angeles firm run by Ronald W. Burkle, would provide a needed cash infusion to Pathmark, which has been struggling with declining sales in some intensely competitive markets. The chain, based in Carteret, N.J., has more than 140 stores, most of them in New York and New Jersey.
