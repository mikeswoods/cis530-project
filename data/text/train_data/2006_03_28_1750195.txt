Tokyopop, the publisher of Japanese-style comic books known as manga, announced last month that it had renewed its contract with a division of the Perseus Books Group to distribute Tokyopop's popular graphic novels to bookstores. Yesterday it said it had reversed course and given its distribution business to HarperCollins Publishers.
As part of the new deal, Tokyopop and HarperCollins also announced a joint publishing arrangement to create a new line of manga titles based on the books of HarperCollins authors, beginning with Meg Cabot, creator of the popular ''Princess Diaries'' series.
