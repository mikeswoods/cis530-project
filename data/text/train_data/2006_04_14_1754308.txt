The Justice Department is seeking a court order to block a Michigan couple from promoting what the government says is the No. 1 tax scheme in the country and to force them to return more than $20,000 in tax refunds. The government also sued seven people it said used the couple's advice, in a move to recover the refunds they obtained.
The main action was against Peter Eric Hendrickson, 50, of Commerce Township, Mich., and his wife, Doreen, 51, who maintain that only a narrow slice of income is subject to tax. Mr. Hendrickson's self-published book, ''Cracking the Code,'' shows people how to exploit what he considers loopholes in the Internal Revenue Service system for processing refunds.
