J. P. Morgan, in its latest push to improve an investment banking franchise, has hired a senior banker from Morgan Stanley, according to people briefed on the matter.
The hiring of Marty Dolan, a managing director who covers the insurance industry, continues the trend of large financial conglomerates poaching the traditional investment banks for deal-making talent. Mr. Dolan's departure may also be indicative of some uncertainty in Morgan Stanley's financial institutions banking unit, long a jewel of the investment bank, which has had several bankers leave in recent months.
