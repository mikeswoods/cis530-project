At age 7, Jabious Williams recalls, he walked a mile to a self-serve Exxon station where he offered to pump gas for tips. Working after school and on weekends, he said, he typically earned $30 to $50 a day to help support his single-parent family.
He and his brother, Anthony, grew up in Anacostia, a neighborhood in southeast Washington, plagued by gang violence. Homeless for a time, they lived with their mother in their aunt's two-bedroom apartment.
