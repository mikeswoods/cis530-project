FOR many investors, finding the right mix of stocks and bonds is a task better left to a professional. But there is a middle ground between going it alone and hiring a financial adviser: picking a mutual fund that blends stock, bond and money market funds all in one, and that tailors the investment mix to the approximate year you plan to retire.
Fund companies like Fidelity Investments, T.Rowe Price and Vanguard offer these portfolios, also called life cycle or target maturity funds, which try to strike a balance between growth and income and continuously adjust the allocation as retirement grows nearer. For example, a 30-year-old worker who expects to retire at 65 might choose a 2040 fund, which would start with an aggressive investment mix providing a relatively high concentration in stocks, then taper toward conservatism as that target year approached.
