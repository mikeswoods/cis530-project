When Stephen J. Hemsley joined UnitedHealth Group after 23 years with the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, he was greeted with a grant of 400,000 stock options dated shortly after he started in June 1997.
There was just one thing: the options carried a stock price based on the market price five months earlier, when he did not yet work for UnitedHealth, one of the largest health insurers in the country. The difference in dates effectively created a built-in gain of $7.26 for every share.
