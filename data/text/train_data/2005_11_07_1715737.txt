A new method of crash-testing minivans showed that Honda, Nissan and Toyota models are among the safest when struck by a sport utility vehicle or a pickup truck, according to a report released Sunday.
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety assessed the safety of six minivans by simulating a crash in which an S.U.V. or a pickup truck slammed into the side of the minivan at 31 miles an hour. The tests involved only new models that were not going to be redesigned by the manufacturer in the near future.
