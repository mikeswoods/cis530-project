ECONOMISTS argue for free trade. They have two centuries of theory and experience to back them up. And they have recent empirical studies of how the liberalization of trade has increased productivity in less-developed countries like Chile and India. Lowering trade barriers, they maintain, not only cuts costs for consumers but aids economic growth and makes the general public better off.
Even so, free trade is a tough sell. ''The truth of the matter is that we have one heck of a time explaining these benefits to the larger public, a public gripped by free trade fatigue,'' the economist Daniel Trefler wrote in an article last fall in The American Economic Review.
