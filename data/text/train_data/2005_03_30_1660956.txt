The New York State Insurance Department announced yesterday that it would require the chief executives of insurance companies it regulates to certify, under oath, that certain insurance transactions were conducted for legitimate economic reasons and not as a way to manipulate financial reporting results.
The directive, issued as the insurance industry is under scrutiny by federal and state regulators, applies to finite reinsurance. Insurance companies buy reinsurance to offload some of their risk. Finite reinsurance is used to try to manage expensive claims over time.
