BY the end of this month, all 77 Westin hotels in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean will have converted to an all smoke-free format, making Westin the first upscale hotel chain to ban indoor smoking.
Officials at Westin, a part of the Starwood Hotels and Resorts real estate investment trust, say that the move is in response to the desires of an overwhelming percentage of travelers.
