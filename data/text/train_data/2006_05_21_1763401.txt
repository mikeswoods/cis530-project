AFTER the dollar's recent slide, some investors may be feeling a bit like deer caught in the headlights. But if you were unprepared for the dollar's fall, don't panic, several Wall Street strategists say. You may want to react by changing the composition of your portfolio, but fluctuations of the dollar shouldn't be your only concern.
''Buying stocks just because of a falling dollar is not a good strategy,'' said Henry McVey, chief United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. ''But buying stocks based on good fundamentals, and getting the tailwind from a falling dollar, that is a good strategy.''
