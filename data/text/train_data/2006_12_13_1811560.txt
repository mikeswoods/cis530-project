In a move that will enable its employees to earn more money from stock options -- and perhaps motivate them to settle for fewer of them in pay packages as a result -- Google said yesterday that it would create a system allowing options to be sold as well as exercised.
Under the program, Google will grant employees a new type of option, called a transferable stock option. The company will work with Morgan Stanley to set up a market that will enable financial institutions and other investors to bid for those options.
