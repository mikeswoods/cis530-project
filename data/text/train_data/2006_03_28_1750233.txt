Defense lawyers sought on Monday to undercut testimony by Enron's former treasurer, Ben F. Glisan Jr., that he warned Kenneth L. Lay that Enron was running low on cash shortly before Mr. Lay told investors the company was financially healthy.
Under questioning by Bruce Collins, a lawyer for Mr. Lay, Mr. Glisan acknowledged that he had assured Mr. Lay, the chief executive, and a group of directors that Enron had enough cash to operate.
