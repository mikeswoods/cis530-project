The admission last week by the big accounting firm KPMG of ''unlawful conduct'' in selling tax shelters may help shield the firm from criminal indictment, but it heightens its vulnerability to costly civil litigation.
KPMG's acknowledgment, in which it said it ''takes full responsibility'' and ''deeply regrets'' tax shelter abuses, may also undermine some fellow corporate defendants in civil lawsuits: businesses that worked with the accounting firm to sell and operate the tax shelters and that now potentially face hundreds of millions of dollars in claims.
