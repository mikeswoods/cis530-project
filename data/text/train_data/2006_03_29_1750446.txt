IN a television commercial for Bud Light during the Super Bowl and Olympics, three men climb onto the roofs of their houses, telling their wives that they were going to clean gutters and repair satellite dishes. Instead, the men break out the Bud Light and lawn chairs. One man eventually falls through the roof and into his living room.
Anheuser-Busch, the makers of Bud Light, says the ad was a spoof.
