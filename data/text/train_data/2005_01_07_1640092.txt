Viacom yesterday named Brad Grey, one of the most prominent talent managers in Hollywood, chairman and chief executive of its troubled Paramount Motion Picture Group.
The move promises further change at an operation that has been among Hollywood's weakest in recent years. Mr. Grey succeeds both Sherry Lansing, who earlier announced her planned retirement as studio chief, and Jonathan Dolgen, who left as chairman of Viacom's entertainment group last June.
