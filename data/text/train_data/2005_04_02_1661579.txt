MCI said yesterday that it would reopen merger talks with Qwest Communications International, which bid $8.9 billion for the company on Thursday.
MCI's board agreed this week to be bought by Verizon Communications for $7.6 billion, and has started making the necessary filings with regulators. But Qwest continues to lobby for its higher bid, which it has revised three times and which is now 19 percent higher than Verizon's.
