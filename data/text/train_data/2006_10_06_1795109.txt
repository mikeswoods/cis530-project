Ryanair Holdings, the low-fare airline based in Ireland, started a 1.48 billion euro ($1.88 billion) hostile bid for a rival, the Aer Lingus Group, in a move that could bring the budget carrier to the United States.
The deal would propel Ryanair outside of its growing European footprint and across the Atlantic to the 11 cities in the United States that Aer Lingus serves, as well as to Dubai, where it would go head-to-head with other long-distance carriers.
