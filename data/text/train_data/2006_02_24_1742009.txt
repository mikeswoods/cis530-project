The European Union's trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, has announced plans to impose tariffs this spring to slow the flow of leather shoes from China and Vietnam into Europe, but he also warned European retailers that they should absorb the higher cost of goods.
Over several months, Europe will phase in import duties of 19.4 percent on some Chinese-made footwear and duties of nearly 16.8 percent on some Vietnamese-made shoes, beginning in early April.
