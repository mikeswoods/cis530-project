The investment banks that are being wooed to back a rival bid for the New York Stock Exchange agreed yesterday to study the exchange's deal with Archipelago independently.
John J. Mack, the Wall Street veteran who is advising the bankers, spoke with John A. Thain, the chief executive of the exchange, and said that his primary role would be to ensure that Mr. Thain made his case to the chief executives that the proposed merger with Archipelago, the electronic trading platform, represented the best deal for seat holders.
