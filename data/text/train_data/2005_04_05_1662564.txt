With General Motors losing its once dominant grip on American car buyers, its chairman and chief executive, Rick Wagoner, took direct control of the company's North American operations on Monday in an effort to overcome a drought in profit and sales.
Mr. Wagoner, 52, reduced the authority of the two most senior North American executives, Robert A. Lutz and Gary Cowger, in a move analysts saw as a sign that his job depends on fixing the company's performance at home. Lucrative sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles propped up G.M.'s performance in the late 1990's until competitors like Toyota and Nissan let loose a wave of their own trucks.
