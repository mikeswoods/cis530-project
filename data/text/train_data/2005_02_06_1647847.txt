IS there a crisis in Social Security? The White House says yes. ''Social Security was a great moral success of the 20th century, and we must honor its great purposes in this new century,'' President Bush said last week in his State of the Union address. ''The system, however, on its current path, is headed toward bankruptcy.''
Others, especially left-leaning research organizations, say no. Dire warnings ''seriously misrepresent Social Security's financing and the challenges the program faces,'' said a report released last month by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
