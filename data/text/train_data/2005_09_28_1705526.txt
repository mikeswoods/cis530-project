Dell, which has beaten its competition by slicing profit margins and turning low-price computers into a commodity, is now turning to the high end. It will announce today that it will begin selling a line of desktop and laptop computers it is marketing as luxury models.
While expensive laptops are nothing new, trying to sell them as a luxury product is. Dell said its new XPS brand would be sold at higher prices -- and fatter margins -- than its Dimension PC's and Inspiron laptops, starting at $2,700 for the laptop and $1,100 for entry-priced units of three desktop models.
