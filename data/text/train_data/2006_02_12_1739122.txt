FULL employment! The United States has rarely entered that paradise. There was a hint of it in the late 1990's, but for Americans under the age of 50, the experience has been so fleeting that they may not realize full employment was once a hotly pursued goal -- a condition considered so important that many politicians wanted it legislated and not left to chance.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt put full employment on the table in 1944, declaring that having a job was a basic human right. During World War II, the nation actually achieved full employment. And twice since then, Congress has considered bills that would have guaranteed a job at decent pay for every adult who wanted work. That doesn't mean everyone; lots of people don't want to work. But in a society that legislated full employment, the government would be the employer of last resort if the private sector came up short of good jobs for those who wanted them.
