There will be a 100th birthday party in New York for the entertainment trade magazine Variety, but not all of the publication's managers are invited.
The celebration, planned for Sept. 24 at Sardi's, the venerable Manhattan show business haunt, is limited mainly to ''people who worked at Variety in the 'Silverman era,''' according to Syd Silverman, who sold the publication in 1987. Anyone hired after 1987, including the current editor, Peter Bart, is not on the guest list.
