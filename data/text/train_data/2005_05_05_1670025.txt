The Cleveland Clinic gave an apparent reprieve to a controversial Johnson & Johnson heart failure treatment yesterday when a committee overruled more than four dozen of its cardiologists by deciding that the drug, Natrecor, would remain in use at the clinic.
The panel, composed of doctors from various disciplines, overruled the recommendation of about 50 members of the clinic's cardiovascular medicine department, who had voted last week to ban or severely restrict use of Natrecor after two studies in medical journals indicated that it increased the risk of kidney impairment and death.
