The publisher of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman is getting a makeover. DC Comics, a division of Warner Brothers Entertainment, is unveiling a new logo today.
The new logo -- the letters DC encircled by a whirlpool-like ring with a single star -- will be used to brand DC Comics across all media, including comics, toys, television and film. The new look replaces the old logo -- the DC letters in a circle and bounded by four stars -- that has been on the covers of DC Comics since the mid-1970's.
