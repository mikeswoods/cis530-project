TECHNOLOGY stocks were big movers last year, but only some moved in the right direction. Shares of companies involved in Internet retailing rose 80 percent in 2004, while those of Internet software and services companies climbed 66.8 percent, ranking both categories among the best performers of 113 stock market sectors followed by Standard & Poor's.
Technology consultants and makers of semiconductor equipment, by contrast, were the two worst sectors, showing losses of 31.4 percent and 25 percent, compared with a gain of 8.99 percent for S.&P.'s 500-stock index for the year.
