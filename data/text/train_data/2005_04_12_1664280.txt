MBIA'S giant bond insurer remains a member in good standing of an elite club rated triple-A. But with its parent company, MBIA Inc., now under scrutiny from regulators, some investors and analysts have been forced to consider what would happen if MBIA were to lose that status.
Early last month, MBIA Inc. said it would restate seven years of results because of two finite insurance deals it struck in 1998. A few weeks later, the company said it had received new subpoenas from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York attorney general's office. It is the uncertainty about the wide-ranging investigation into insurance, and the prospect of further restatements, that has driven concerns about MBIA's status.
