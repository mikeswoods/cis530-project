NIELSEN MEDIA RESEARCH is taking significant additional steps to address the complaints of critics who have been increasingly vociferous in challenging how the company gathers television ratings data.
The steps, described as an action plan by Nielsen in a detailed eight-page letter, include a proposal from the company to set aside $2.5 million to pay for a year's worth of methodological research. The research would be conducted in cooperation with Nielsen's clients rather than unilaterally, the company pledged, and the results after the first year would determine the budget for subsequent spending.
