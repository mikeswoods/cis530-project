Seven weeks after negotiating their exit from the Walt Disney Company with talk of building a ''fully integrated media company,'' Harvey and Bob Weinstein, the brothers who founded Miramax Films, have made their first strategic deal -- an acquisition fund and distribution arrangement with Rainbow Media Holdings, the programming subsidiary of Cablevision Systems Corporation.
The Weinstein brothers will be given an undisclosed sum of money to acquire low-budget films for distribution mainly on DVD and television, and their company will become the sole home-video distributor and overseas sales agent for Rainbow's IFC Films unit. Production credits for IFC Films include ''The Ballad of Jack and Rose.'' It was the theatrical distributor of ''My Big Fat Greek Wedding'' in 2002 and, with Lions Gate, ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' last year.
