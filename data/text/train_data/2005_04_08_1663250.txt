Concerns about prescribing pain relievers deepened yesterday, doctors said, after the announcements that Pfizer would withdraw its embattled painkiller Bextra from the market and that tough warning labels would be added to other leading pain medications.
The drugs, which have come under increasing scrutiny, will most likely be prescribed for shorter periods, while patients in higher risk groups will be encouraged to try alternatives, like low dose opiates and pain patches, according to doctors interviewed yesterday.
