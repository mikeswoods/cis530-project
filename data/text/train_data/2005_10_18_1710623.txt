Warner Brothers Entertainment, the maker of hit television shows like ''ER'' and films like the Harry Potter series, is looking to cut costs next year because the division is anticipating a slowdown in revenue, according to two Warner studio executives.
The cuts, which could include layoffs, have not been determined yet because both the television unit and the film unit are reviewing their budgets.
