At 2.5 pounds and with a 12.1-inch screen, the Dell Latitude X1 resembles an elongated, pumped-up version of a digital organizer, or perhaps a Sony Vaio knock-off. But it actually is a Samsung Q30 in slightly altered form (Dell licensed the design) and it is a workhorse, intended to appeal to the business traveler with a need for wireless access.
The Latitude is an inch thick, and can easily be stored in the side pocket of a suitcase or even the back pocket of a pair of baggy jeans. The liquid-crystal display is easy to read in wan sunlight, and the antispill keyboard is latte-proof.
