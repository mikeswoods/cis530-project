Prosecutors investigating illegal wiretapping by a former private detective, Anthony Pellicano, have charged a film director, John McTiernan, with hiring the detective to wiretap conversations of a movie producer and then lying about it to F.B.I. agents.
Mr. McTiernan, 55, was accused Monday of having made false statements after he told investigators in an interview on Feb. 13 that he had no knowledge of any wiretapping by Mr. Pellicano and never discussed it with him.
