THE Dolans, that increasingly dysfunctional family that controls Cablevision, would make a great reality television series.
The story has it all -- a little Shakespeare, some Sophocles and a lot of Norman Lear. And, oh, what characters! Charles F. Dolan, the legendary yet fanatical father who founded the cable giant; James, the former substance-abusing son turned would-be company hero; Tom, the ''other'' son you've never heard of who is clearly the father's favorite; and the rest of the gang, all living at the family compound in Bethpage, N.Y.
