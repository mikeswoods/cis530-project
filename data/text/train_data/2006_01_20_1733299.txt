After aggressive Internet orders by individual investors contributed to a near-collapse of stock trading here Wednesday, executives of the Tokyo Stock Exchange announced plans on Thursday to nearly double the system's capacity for trading and clearing stocks by year's end.
Volume again approached the exchange's ceiling, and officials said they would again shorten trading hours by 30 minutes on Friday, as they did Thursday. Despite the curtailed session, the market bounced back smartly, rising 2.3 percent, and erasing much of the 2.9 percent drop on Wednesday. The percentage point gain was the biggest here in three months.
