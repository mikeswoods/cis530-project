Verizon Communications said yesterday that it would allow current customers in 13 Northeast states to drop telephone service but continue to get high-speed Internet access through digital subscriber lines.
Verizon characterized the new policy, which took effect yesterday, as a first step toward offering stand-alone D.S.L. services in all regions where it operates.
