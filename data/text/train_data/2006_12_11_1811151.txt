The Public Broadcasting System has added a new revenue channel to the pledge drives and sales of Masterpiece Theater DVDs it uses to supplement its federal funding: a PBS coffee blend.
Last week, PBS announced a partnership with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, in the first non-media-related commercial venture for the television company. Green Mountain has produced and packaged a PBS Blend, which is being sold by Green Mountain and the PBS Web site, shoppbs.org, in a brand licensing arrangement. PBS will also make the coffee available to its member stations as a product to offer during on-air fund-raising pledge drives.
