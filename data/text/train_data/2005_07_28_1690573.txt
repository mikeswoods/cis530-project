Wal-Mart Stores filed a suit yesterday against Thomas M. Coughlin, a former vice chairman, seeking to void his retirement package and to recover funds the company said he fraudulently siphoned from the company.
The lawsuit, filed in Benton County Circuit Court in Arkansas, came after Wal-Mart sent a letter last month to Mr. Coughlin's lawyers, accusing him of ''a scheme to misappropriate corporate funds and property for his own personal benefit.''
