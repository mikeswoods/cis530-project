Shortly after the New York Stock Exchange announced on Wednesday a deal to transform itself, John A. Thain, the chief executive of the exchange, received an angry phone call from E. Stanley O'Neal, the chief executive of Merrill Lynch.
Mr. O'Neal was upset that Mr. Thain, a former president of Goldman Sachs and a significant shareholder in the firm, should have allowed Goldman to advise both the exchange and Archipelago, the electronic trading system it plans to acquire. In a brief, blunt exchange, Mr. O'Neal said that Goldman's role in the deal was inappropriate, according to a person who was briefed on the conversation.
