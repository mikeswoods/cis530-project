IF you do not know why she is a publishing legend, Jane Friedman will be happy to tell you. ''I am actually credited with inventing the author tour,'' Ms. Friedman, the president and chief executive of HarperCollins Publishers, told a group of aspiring editors and publicists recently at New York University's Center for Publishing.
That boast is not without merit. In 1970, as a young publicist at Alfred A. Knopf, Ms. Friedman was assigned to schedule Julia Child on morning television shows to promote the second volume of her seminal work, ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking.'' Ms. Friedman added a series of kitchen demonstrations by Mrs. Child at department stores across the country, and -- voil√†! -- the author tour was born.
