On the Saturday before the Academy Awards, film executives jammed into a tent on a Santa Monica beach to trade accolades at the Independent Spirit Awards, an event devoted to honoring independent films.
The open secret, of course, is that most independent film labels today are owned by major Hollywood studios: Focus Features, the producer and distributor of ''Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,'' is owned by NBC-Universal, a division of General Electric, and Fox Searchlight, which produced last year's critical darling, ''Sideways,'' is a part of Rupert Murdoch's multinational behemoth News Corporation.
