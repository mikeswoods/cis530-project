Microsoft's battle with the European Commission escalated Thursday, as the company accused the commission of colluding with its competitors in the software market and of again withholding documents it says are crucial to its defense in an antitrust case.
With the threat of daily fines of 2 million euros ($2.4 million) hanging over it, Microsoft is facing a new suit brought just before Christmas, when the commission accused the company of failing to honor the antitrust ruling made in March 2004. In that ruling, the commission found the company guilty of monopoly abuse and ordered it to change the way it sold its software in Europe.
