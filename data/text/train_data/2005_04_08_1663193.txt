The New York Stock Exchange yesterday named Marshall N. Carter, a former chief executive of the State Street Corporation, an institutional investment firm, as its new chairman.
Mr. Carter, 64, succeeds John S. Reed, the former chairman of Citigroup, who was brought in to steady the exchange after the departure of Richard A. Grasso 18 months ago. Mr. Grasso was forced out as chairman and chief executive of the world's largest stock exchange shortly after it was disclosed that he was awarded a pay package of $139.5 million in deferred compensation and retirement benefits in 2003.
