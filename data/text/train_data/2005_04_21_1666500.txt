Morgan Stanley was shaken by another round of defections yesterday as eight senior traders left the firm for Deutsche Bank, adding to a stream of executive departures in recent weeks.
In some ways, yesterday's resignations may be the most painful yet for Philip J. Purcell, Morgan Stanley's embattled chief executive. Unlike many of those who previously departed, the eight stock traders, three of whom were managing directors, represented the next generation of young, elite Morgan Stanley talent that Mr. Purcell and his team have been trying to cultivate.
