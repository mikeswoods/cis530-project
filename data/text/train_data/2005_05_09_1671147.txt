The maker of a novel computer memory chip has developed a new generation of its technology, pushing forward in the quest for chips that are smaller and denser, and thus less expensive for use in consumer electronics.
The company, Matrix Semiconductor of Santa Clara, Calif., is expected to announce on Tuesday that its approach -- storing data in an array of circuits stacked in four levels -- had yielded one-gigabit chips that are 10 percent smaller than its previous version and have twice the memory of the original 512-megabit chips.
