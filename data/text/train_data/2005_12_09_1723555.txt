So there I was Sunday night, minding my own business in the World of Warcraft online computer game, killing a few rock elementals in the Badlands, when I received two unsolicited private messages from a player with the unlikely name Hfasdlf.
Both messages said the same thing: ''Hi,plz visit http://www.zlywy.com. The low Price server$9.99=100G $39.99=500G $76.99=1000G.''
