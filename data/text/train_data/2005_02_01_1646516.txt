I fly more than 300,000 miles a year for business, and I've been to some of the most far-flung places on earth. When I first created the shoe I had no technological equipment on which to run tests, so I had to test them on my feet by walking and hiking and basically researching their endurance in all kinds of weather conditions.
The strangest place I've been is probably Mongolia. It was wintertime, and I spent the night sleeping inside the tents of the Mongolian tribes, and drank mare's milk and ate cheese.
