MY company used to promote a knife set -- a cleaver, steak knives, a 12-inch bread knife and a chef's carving knife. They were sharp and menacing-looking, with black handles and serrated steel blades.
Before 9/11, I traveled with product samples in my carry-on luggage all the time and never thought anything of it. No one ever questioned me or my sales staff about the utensils. Flying with sharp objects was a nonissue. It didn't occur to me that the blades could also make effective weapons.
