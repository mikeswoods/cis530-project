LONG before Enron, a young Chicago financier began building and buying utility companies. He promoted electricity to housewives, peddled his stock to their husbands and amassed (thanks to his cunning grasp of finance) an energy empire spanning most of the country.
It is long past time for wondering how such a fable might have ended. Has this country ever produced a financial magician who did not end his days fighting prosecution and public disgrace?
