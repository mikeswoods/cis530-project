Citigroup, which has been disposing of its noncore assets, is in talks with Legg Mason about a possible sale of its asset management unit, according to two executives who have been briefed on the discussions.
The talks, which the executives say are at an advanced stage, reflect a growing dedication on Citigroup's part to focus on its distribution businesses, like consumer banking and retail brokerage, rather than divisions like asset management that develop and manage funds for retail and institutional investors.
