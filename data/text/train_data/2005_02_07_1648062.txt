The United States attorney's office in Manhattan is investigating individual traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on suspicion of cheating customers through illegal trading practices already under scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the exchange itself, according to someone who has been briefed on the investigation.
The criminal inquiry is an escalation of the investigation, begun by the Big Board in the summer of 2002, into the activities of stock exchange specialists -- traders who manage the buying and selling of particular stocks and have an obligation to stabilize markets in the stocks they manage -- from 1999 to 2003. There are two trading practices at issue in the investigations: executing proprietary orders before customer orders, and getting involved in a trade that should be carried out automatically with no intervention.
