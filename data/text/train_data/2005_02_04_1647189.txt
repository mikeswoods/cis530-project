Toyota, the world's second-largest carmaker, posted a 3.5 percent rise in quarterly profits on Thursday as spending on its ambitious global expansion plans curtailed growth in its earnings.
Toyota, second only to General Motors in the number of cars sold last year, posted a net profit of 296.5 billion yen, or $2.85 billion, for the three months ended Dec. 31. Sales rose 6 percent, to 4.64 trillion yen, or $44.7 billion, for the quarter.
