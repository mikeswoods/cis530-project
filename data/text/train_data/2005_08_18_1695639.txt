The accounting firm KPMG is quietly putting the boxing gloves back on. Even as KPMG is in discussions with federal prosecutors to settle a criminal investigation over its sale of what the Internal Revenue Service says are bogus tax shelters, the firm has been taking on former clients who have sued it over those same shelters.
Among those former clients are two wealthy sons of Robert C. McNair, a Houston oilman and the owner of the Houston Texans of the National Football League. The McNair brothers, R. Cary and D. Calhoun, sued KPMG in a state court in Houston in December 2003, contending that the firm in 1999 knowingly sold them bogus tax shelters.
