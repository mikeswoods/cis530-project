The 2006 models of large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks by General Motors have barely hit the market, but the company said yesterday that it would start using employee discount offers to ensure that they sell.
Some analysts saw the move as the latest sign that America's appetite for gas guzzlers, like G.M.'s Chevrolet Suburban and Cadillac Escalade, is beginning to wane as fuel prices rise. The move was also something of a reversal for G.M., which has suggested in the past that employee discounts will largely be used to clear out its 2005 models, while 2006 models will be shifted to a new strategy using lower sticker prices.
