Electronic Arts yesterday became the second major video game maker this week to warn that it was seeing soft demand from retailers as it heads into the holiday season.
A competitor, Take Two Interactive, told investors on Monday that results for its fiscal fourth quarter would miss previous projections, in part because orders from retailers have slowed. Take Two's stock plunged $3.12, or 15 percent, to close at $17.53 yesterday, a drop that analysts said was also tied to the delayed release of new games and disappointing financial performance.
