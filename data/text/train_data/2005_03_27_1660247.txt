I WAS an extremely shy, awkward kid. I'm 5-foot-10, and I've had the feeling of being 5-foot-10 since I was 10 years old. It wasn't until I got to college that I developed a lot of self-confidence. I went to an obscure but wonderful small college, Lynchburg College in Virginia, much to my parents' chagrin. My mother had gone to Purdue, my dad to Carnegie Mellon. They wanted me to go to a school with a big name. But I had a lot of support at college.
I have worked since I was 15, so early on I had a sense of how to support myself. My parents had rough times financially. I was the oldest of three girls. We weren't poor, but we went without the nicest clothes; we didn't go on elaborate vacations or buy brand-new cars. I thought I'd really made it when I got to college and was able to buy Pepperidge Farm instead of day-old bread.
