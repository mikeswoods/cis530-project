PITY Sammy Sosa. If the Chicago Cubs dump him after his contract expires this year, Mr. Sosa, the struggling slugger, will receive only a $4.5 million buyout payment and $3.5 million in severance.
True, his send-off would be more lucrative than the one recently awarded to a group of baseball umpires: several got about $400,000 each to settle a severance dispute. And it is far better than the severance pay state officials want for 1,100 blue-collar workers at Great Northern Paper, a bankrupt company in Portland, Me. The state is suing the company's owner, seeking an average of about $23,000 for each of its former employees.
