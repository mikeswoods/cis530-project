General Motors laid off several hundred white-collar workers on Tuesday, its latest move in a restructuring plan that is cutting deeply into all ranks of the company.
Also on Tuesday, a top United Automobile Workers official said he expected the auto parts supplier Delphi to ask a bankruptcy judge to throw out its labor contracts Friday. Such a move would raise the likelihood of a strike at Delphi, which could cripple production at G.M.
