With demand growing for advertising space on the Internet, CNN.com plans to enhance and reorganize its Web offerings, adding free features that it hopes will attract both viewers and ad dollars.
In June, CNN will make video clips free on its Web site for the first time, dropping a $4.95 fee, said Susan Grant, executive vice president of CNN News Services. Other major news sites, including the ones run by Fox News and CBS News, already provide free video; CNN and ABC News had chosen to make it a subscription service.
