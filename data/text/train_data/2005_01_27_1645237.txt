The New York Stock Exchange, which has been unsucessful with previous efforts to expand beyond stocks, may decide to seek to trade other financial instruments, its chief executive said on Wednesday.
The executive, John A. Thain, interviewed at the World Economic Forum, seemed confident that the Big Board was in a position to withstand threats to its franchise in stocks and was ready to at least contemplate the possibility of expanding out of corporate equities. He also said there had been positive reaction to the idea that the exchange open earlier in the day.
