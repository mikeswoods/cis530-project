The simmering controversy over data from the 2004 clinical trial that caused Merck to stop selling Vioxx bubbled up again yesterday, as The New England Journal of Medicine retracted part of a paper it had published about the test.
In a correction posted online, the journal said that the paper's abstract -- or summary -- should no longer claim that Vioxx causes heart damage only when it is used for more than 18 months. That claim, published as one of the 2004 article's conclusions, has been at the center of Merck's defense against lawsuits filed by people who say that Vioxx, the brand name for the drug rofecoxib, caused their heart attacks and strokes.
