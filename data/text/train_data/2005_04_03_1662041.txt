Perhaps Jamie Reidy was na√Øve, but he said it barely occurred to him that Eli Lilly & Company would object to his new book, ''Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman,'' a humorous take on his life as a Pfizer Inc. sales representative from 1995 to 2000. ''Hard Sell'' has nothing to do with his more recent job as a sales trainer for Lilly.
But Mr. Reidy had a big surprise coming. Lilly was not amused. Last Monday, two weeks after ''Hard Sell'' hit bookstore shelves, the company gave Mr. Reidy the boot. A spokesman at Lilly's headquarters in Indianapolis, Philip C. Belt, said the book describes behavior the company finds ''inappropriate'' and in violation of its policies.
