The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation confirmed yesterday that it had hired Deutsche Bank to sell a 10 percent stake in the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, hoping to collect more than $500 million.
The federal agency is trying to take advantage of a higher-than-expected price on UAL shares ahead of the airline's anticipated exit from bankruptcy on Wednesday. The agency took over United's pension plans last year with a funding shortfall of about $10 billion.
