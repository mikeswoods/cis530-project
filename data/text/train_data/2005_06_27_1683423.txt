IN many respects, the career of Steven T. Florio, the former chief executive of Cond√© Nast, is an amazing American success story. A knockabout guy from Jamaica, Queens, blessed with a very finite set of skills -- a knack for selling advertising pages and a facility for slicing the conversational baloney -- Mr. Florio ended up running the second-largest, and arguably the most prestigious, magazine company in the United States. What a grand land of opportunity we live in.
Rightly told, Mr. Florio's story would not be a best seller, but it would have significant charms. But apparently it won't be written, at least not by him.
