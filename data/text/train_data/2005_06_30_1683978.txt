Bank of America, after absorbing FleetBoston last year in a $50 billion deal, now has 5,800 branches in 30 states. J.P. Morgan Chase, having bought Bank One for $60 billion in stock in another 2004 mega-merger, now counts 2,500 branches. Royal Bank of Scotland, the parent of Citizens Bank, increased its presence in the United States to 1,500 branches after its acquisition of Charter One, also last year.
Then there is the Western National Bank in Phoenix. It has a single location, at the intersection of 24th Street and Camelback Road, on the ground floor of an officer tower in a business district known as the Camelback Corridor. And it does not even have a drive-through window, because the entrepreneur who opened it in February could not find a piece of real estate that would accommodate one.
