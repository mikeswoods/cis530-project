THE shares of Fidelity Federal Bancorp have always been thinly traded, and its executives often wondered why it bothered to be a public company at all. Still, they never really considered delisting the stock until Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley law, with its myriad new reporting rules, in 2002.
In November, the bank announced that it was ''going dark'' -- delisting its stock from the Nasdaq market. That means it will no longer need to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
