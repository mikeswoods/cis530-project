An American-based energy company, Moncrief Oil International, is threatening to sue two German companies, contending that an agreement they signed with the Russian giant Gazprom interfered with Moncrief's existing contracts to develop natural gas fields in western Siberia.
Moncrief -- a privately owned, family-founded business in Fort Worth -- has sent letters to the German companies, E.On and Wintershall, a gas-distribution unit of the German chemical group BASF, informing them of its plans to take legal action in the German courts, Moncrief's president, Jeffrey Miller, said Thursday in a telephone interview.
