Later this month, one of the nation's biggest shopping mall developers is opening a mall in Jacksonville, Fla., that breaks with the old rules of what a mall should look like.
It has just one department store, Dillard's; its other anchors will be Dick's Sporting Goods, the Cheesecake Factory and Barnes & Noble. The mall will include two apartment complexes and a hotel. A Target is planned at a site across the street.
