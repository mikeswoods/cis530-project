Infinity Broadcasting wants to blanket Madison Avenue today with the message that it really, really, really believes there is life after Howard Stern.
To convey that ardor, all 24 full-page ads in the Oct. 31 issue of Advertising Age, the flagship magazine of the Ad Age Group, are being bought by Infinity to promote its new programming and the lineup of hosts who will succeed Mr. Stern on Jan. 3, after he signs off from Infinity radio stations and moves to Sirius Satellite Radio.
