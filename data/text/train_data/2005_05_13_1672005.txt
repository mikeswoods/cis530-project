Thomas Middelhoff, the German executive who abruptly left the helm of the media giant Bertelsmann three years ago, was named Thursday as chief of KarstadtQuelle, a German retailer struggling to right its flagging mail-order catalog business.
Mr. Middelhoff, 52, had been chairman of the nonexecutive supervisory board of KarstadtQuelle since June 2004, during which time the retailer sold holdings in DSF Deutsches Sport Fernsehen, a German TV sports channel, and Home Shopping Europe, to stem losses and reorganize 85 large department stores.
