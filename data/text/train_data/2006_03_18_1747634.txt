Two States Propose Laws to Stop Wal-Mart Banks  Lawmakers in Michigan and Maryland have introduced bills to restrict Wal-Mart Stores' ability to operate banks in their states. Representative John Gleason in Michigan, a Democrat, proposed a bill yesterday that would bar industrial banks like the one Wal-Mart is seeking to start. Brian Moe, a Democrat the lower house in Maryland, introduced legislation yesterday that would ban Wal-Mart bank branches from its stores. Industrial banks can accept deposits and lend money, raising the possibility that Wal-Mart could open branches in its more than 3,300 United States stores. Wal-Mart has said its bank, to be based in Salt Lake City, would be used for credit card processing to cut fees the chain pays and that it had no plans to open retail banking operations. ''We have no intention of doing what they seem to be trying to prevent,'' a Wal-Mart spokesman, Marty Heires, said. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)
More Internal Accounting Problems at HealthSouth  The HealthSouth Corporation said yesterday that it still had problems with internal financial controls after a huge accounting fraud and would post losses for 2005 that were at least $260 million greater than the previous year. The company, which operates a rehabilitation and medical services chain, made the announcement in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and said its annual report for last year would be delayed until March 31. HealthSouth, which is based in Birmingham, said a report from its accounting firm will contain an ''adverse opinion'' of the company's financial controls, which were revamped after a $2.7 billion accounting fraud that nearly drove the company to bankruptcy after it was revealed in 2003.
