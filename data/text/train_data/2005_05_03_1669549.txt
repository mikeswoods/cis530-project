Alana K. Bassin, a partner at Bowman & Brooke, a products-liability law firm in Minneapolis, has a simple checklist for her business travels: a suitcase for her business suits, an attach√© case for her legal papers and an infant seat for her daughter, Talia.
Just over a year ago, when Talia was 7 months old, Ms. Bassin brought her to a two-week trial in Galveston, Tex., so that she could stick to her nursing schedule. Since then, the pair has hit the road several times, and Ms. Bassin, who is about to give birth for a second time, plans to bring both children on business trips in the future.
