WHEN I have to kill a guy in New Jersey or go to an important mob meeting in Brooklyn, I tend to run late. I tell myself I'll just hot-wire a roadster and speed right over, but then I see some florist shop or nightclub that isn't paying my family protection money, and I just have to stop and have a chat with the owner. No matter how busy you are, there's always time for a shakedown.
In the Electronic Arts action game The Godfather, it is easy to become distracted from the game's central story, wandering off to rob a bank, buy a shady business or steal a rival mob's truck.
