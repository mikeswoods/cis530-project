The Simon Property Group, one of the biggest real estate and shopping mall developers in the United States, said Tuesday that it had formed a partnership with Morgan Stanley and a state-owned Chinese company to develop about a dozen shopping centers in China.
The companies did not disclose their investment in the shopping centers, all of which would be anchored by Wal-Mart outlets. But analysts said the projects could cost as much as $700 million to develop, which would make the deal one of the largest foreign real estate investments ever made in China.
