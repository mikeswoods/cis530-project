The world's biggest bank is hiring the former head of the World Bank. Citigroup said yesterday that James D. Wolfensohn, 71, who left as president of the World Bank last spring after 10 years at the helm, would serve as a global strategy adviser to senior management and clients. He will also become chairman of the Citigroup International Advisory Board in 2006.
His appointment comes just a day after Shengman Zhang, 48, a World Bank managing director from China, was named vice chairman of Citigroup's global banking division and head of its public sector group.
