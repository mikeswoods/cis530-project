Preserved on Hewlett-Packard's campus as a kind of museum exhibit are the spartan offices of William Hewlett and David Packard.
Mr. Hewlett and Mr. Packard, the founders of the fabled Silicon Valley company, did not hole themselves up like so many top executives nowadays but invited people to share ideas. A wedge of darkened linoleum can be found behind each door, evidence that the doors were open in a corporate culture created by the two engineers -- men who favored pocket protectors and short sleeves and summed up their executive style as ''management by wandering around.''
