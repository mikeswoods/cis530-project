MY parents were from Russia, but they would never have met there. They were from different classes. My father's family was poor. They worked in factories when they came to this country, and he eventually became a doctor. My mother came from a wealthy family that had to leave because of the revolution. They sewed their jewelry inside a coat to take it with them. I was born in Brooklyn and moved to Larchmont, N.Y., when I was 12.
I always wanted my own money. I've worked since I was in high school; I knew that money is power. My first job was selling jewelry behind a counter at Wanamaker's. I had a class with Margaret Mead, and I might have become an anthropologist like her, but I've known since I was 4 that I wanted to be an actress. When my preschool teacher put a pussycat hat on me for a play, that was it.
