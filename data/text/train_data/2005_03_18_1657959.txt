Just days after Maurice R. Greenberg stepped down as chief executive of the American International Group, he continues to hold a powerful sway over the management of the insurance giant.
Mr. Greenberg's unusual control stems largely from his role as a top executive of two related, private entities, C.V. Starr and the Starr International Company. As a result, he holds the reins over the vehicles that dole out compensation to A.I.G. executives. Mr. Greenberg is also still chairman of Starr Foundation, one of the nation's largest private foundations, which makes contributions to organizations and charities run by the company's directors.
