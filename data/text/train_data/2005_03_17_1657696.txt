Raymond Simko, the former media director on a federal antidrug account at the New York office of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group, pleaded guilty yesterday in federal court to charges related to overbilling for advertising work on the account.
Mr. Simko, 56, pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to defraud the government, filing false claims and making false statements. His pleas came three weeks after two former colleagues, Thomas Early and Shona Seifert, were found guilty on charges that they also took part in the overbilling in 1999 and 2000.
