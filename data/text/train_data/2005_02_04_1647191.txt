The Royal Dutch/Shell Group reduced its proven oil and gas reserves by an additional 10 percent on Thursday, rattling investors yet again and increasing speculation that the company will ultimately have to buy a better-performing rival to compete with peers like Exxon Mobil and BP.
The cut in reserves, Shell's fifth in just more than a year, came as the company reported record profits, buoyed by high oil prices.
