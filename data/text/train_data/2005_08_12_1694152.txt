An investigation by federal prosecutors into sales of questionable tax shelters took a decisive turn yesterday as a former bank executive pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy, fraud and tax evasion.
The plea is significant because it appears to involve the first criminal charges brought by the government in its investigation of tax shelters sold by KPMG, one of the four largest accounting firms that remain after the conviction and collapse of Arthur Andersen in 2002.
