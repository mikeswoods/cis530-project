Nokia, the world's largest mobile phone company, put an end to succession questions on Monday when it named one of its top executives, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, to replace its longtime chief, Jorma Ollila.
Mr. Kallasvuo, 52, is currently the head of Nokia's biggest group, the mobile phone business. He will become president and chief operating officer of the entire company in October, and chief executive in June 2006, the company said in a statement. A 25-year Nokia veteran and former chief financial officer, Mr. Kallasvuo has helped shore up the company's faltering market share since he took over the mobile phone business in January of last year.
