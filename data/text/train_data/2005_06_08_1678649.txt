Investors are showing signs of losing interest in Chinese stocks just as investment banks are preparing a long list of Chinese initial public offerings. That combination could make it hard to sell all the shares coming to market and could slow China's efforts to privatize its state-owned industries.
Delays in Chinese initial public offerings could also set back big banks like Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS. China has become the world's second-largest generator of investment banking fees for such offerings, ahead of Europe but behind the United States. All of these banks have been successful lately in winning the right to sponsor such offerings, most of them done in Hong Kong.
