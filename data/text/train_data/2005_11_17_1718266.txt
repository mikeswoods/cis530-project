In a report to be released today, the Government Accountability Office strongly urges Congress to act to protect military personnel from the deceptive sales practices and unsuitable investments and insurance policies that the report says have been a disturbing fact of military life.
The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs will examine the study at a hearing today in Washington. The report's delivery to Congress clears the way for the Senate to consider a bill that has been pending since early this year. The bill has twice passed the House with strong bipartisan support.
