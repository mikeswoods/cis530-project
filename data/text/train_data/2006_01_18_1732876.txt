In a move that signals the growing importance of foreign markets to its overall business, Coca-Cola has created a position in charge of all of the company's operations outside of North America and filled it with an executive who revived sales in Eastern Europe in the 1990's.
The appointment places the executive, Muhtar Kent, in line as a possible successor to the chairman and chief executive, E. Neville Isdell, who is 62. Mr. Kent, 53, has spent 22 of the last 27 years working at Coca-Cola and its bottlers.
