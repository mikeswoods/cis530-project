Joseph P. Nacchio has always talked a big game. When he ran Qwest Communications during the Internet bubble of the late 1990's, he bragged that he would topple his biggest foes, the Bell phone companies. When the telecommunications industry went into a free fall afterward, he boasted that Qwest was different and could withstand the turmoil.
Yet Mr. Nacchio begins the biggest fight of his life today because of the many things he did not say. The Justice Department, in a December indictment, claims that he did not pass on to investors warnings that his own managers were giving him about the company's overly ambitious revenue projections. Instead, prosecutors say, Mr. Nacchio kept this crucial information to himself -- while selling 2.5 million shares of Qwest stock over five months in 2001 that generated $100 million in profit.
