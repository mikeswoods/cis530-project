The fast-growing Banco Santander Central Hispano of Spain gained a toehold in the United States on Monday with a $2.4 billion deal for 19.8 percent of Sovereign Bancorp  of Philadelphia and an option to buy the whole bank after 2008.
Sovereign, which has been under pressure from some investors to improve its stock performance, plans to use the proceeds to purchase Independence Community Bank of Brooklyn, which has 120 branches in the New York metropolitan area, for $3.6 billion, Santander executives said.
