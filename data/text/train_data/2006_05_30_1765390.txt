Adding to its sizable investment in the former East Germany, the American chip maker Advanced Micro Devices said Monday that it planned to spend $2.5 billion over the next three years to expand production in Dresden.
The $2.5 billion investment will create about 420 jobs, but Hans Deppe, general manager of AMD's Dresden plant, said most of the money would go to machinery needed to produce 300-millimeter wafers.
