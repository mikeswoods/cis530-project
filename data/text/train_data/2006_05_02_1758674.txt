When Nathan Papadopulos, a public relations manager, needs to set up brief small meetings while on the road, he prefers to use hotel lobbies. Often, they are not the lobbies of the hotels he is staying in.
Last January, for instance, while attending the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Mr. Papadopulos arranged a 15-minute meeting with a journalist in the lobby of Caesars Palace, where neither was staying.
