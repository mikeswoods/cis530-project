THE Lorillard Tobacco Company argued in court yesterday that an antismoking group had violated an agreement by using its ad campaigns to attack the tobacco industry and its employees while trying to persuade teenagers not to smoke.
In an hourlong hearing, the Delaware Supreme Court heard an appeal of a lower court decision last year that rejected Lorillard's claim and upheld the position of the group, the American Legacy Foundation, that the ads were not only truthful but effective.
