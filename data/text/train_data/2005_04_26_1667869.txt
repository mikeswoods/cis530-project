Mark DiMassimo, an advertising executive in New York, recently heard from a major client who decided to pull back on advertising in nationally circulated newspapers. The company's executives wanted to try a more targeted local-newspaper approach -- inspired, perhaps, by the narrowly focused ads proliferating online.
''One day they woke up and said, 'I'm sure some of this advertising is working, but I don't know how to tell if any of it is,''' said Mr. DiMassimo, chief executive and creative director at his own agency.
