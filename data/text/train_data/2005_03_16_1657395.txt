The Vodafone Group, the world's largest mobile telecommunications company, is buying $3.5 billion worth of Romanian and Czech mobile assets from Telesystem International Wireless of Canada, the companies said on Tuesday.
Vodafone is picking up a 79 percent stake in MobiFon of Romania, which serves about half of the country's nearly 10 million mobile customers, and all of Oskar Mobil, which has 1.8 million customers in the Czech Republic. Vodafone already owned 20 percent of MobiFon.
