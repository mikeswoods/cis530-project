Danny Mathis remembers his first years on the job building phone networks in northern Georgia in the 1970's. Then, Mr. Mathis and other technicians at Southern Bell, the predecessor to BellSouth, used to splice thick cables containing 3,600 pairs of wires, or 7,200 phone lines. He and his team would work all day to connect just two 500-foot sections of cable.
These days, Mr. Mathis works far more with fiber optic cable. A single hairlike strand can carry 672 phone calls simultaneously, funnel high-speed broadband connections to homes and carry televisions signals. Technicians can splice 500-foot lengths of fiber in about two hours.
