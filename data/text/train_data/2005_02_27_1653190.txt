IT can be crowded at the top. That is what Mel Karmazin found after CBS, of which he was chief executive, merged with Viacom in 2000. He agreed to stay on as president of Viacom under the combined company's C.E.O., Sumner M. Redstone; four rocky years later, Mr. Karmazin stepped down and cashed in his options.
