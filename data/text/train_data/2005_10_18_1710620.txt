When Sam Loggans saw the United Automobile Workers president, Ron Gettelfinger, at an N.A.A.C.P. event last year, he had a message for the union boss.
''I said, 'G.M. is going to come after our benefits,''' recalled Mr. Loggans, who proudly displays a plaque on his living room wall honoring his 30 years as an electrician at General Motors. Mr. Gettelfinger, he said, looked him in the eye and assured him that benefits for retirees ''were not going to be on the table.''
