The clinical trial was a small one in Germany dealing with an increasingly rare medical problem.

Stents are mesh cylinders inserted in blood vessels to prop them open after blockages are cleared. The new report studied the small subset of patients who receive a bare metal stent but need further treatment after new blockages develop within their stent.
