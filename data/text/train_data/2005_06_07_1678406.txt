Loopholes in the federal pension law allowed United Airlines to treat its pension fund as solid for years, when in fact it was dangerously weakening, according to a new analysis by the agency that guarantees pensions.

Those loopholes give companies ways -- all perfectly legal -- to make their pension plans look healthier than they really are, reducing the amount of money the companies must contribute.
