US Airways said last night that Republic Airways Holding had agreed to invest $125 million in the airline once it emerges from bankruptcy protection. It was the second such investment that US Airways has obtained in the last month and greatly increases its chances of surviving.
Under the agreement, US Airways could sell some of its slots at La Guardia Airport to Republic, the parent company of Chautauqua Airlines and Republic Airlines. Both Chautauqua and Republic fly as US Airways Express.
