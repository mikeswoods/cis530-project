Universal Pictures, in the first major executive change since it was acquired by General Electric last year, said Tuesday that Mary Parent and Scott Stuber, both vice chairmen of worldwide production, would leave to become film producers at the studio.
They will be succeeded by another Universal executive, Donna Langley, who is being promoted to president of production.
