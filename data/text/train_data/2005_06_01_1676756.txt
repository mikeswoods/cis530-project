The American International Group, the insurance giant whose accounting practices are under investigation by federal and state regulators, released its long-awaited restatement yesterday, reducing its profits by nearly $4 billion over five years. It laid much of the blame for the accounting problems at the feet of its former chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, and its former chief financial officer, Howard I. Smith.
In its annual financial report, the company reduced its 2004 profit, by 12 percent, or $1.32 billion, earning $9.73 billion rather than the $11.1 billion it reported in February. A.I.G. also increased its reserves for asbestos and environmental claims by $850 million before taxes in 2004. In total, A.I.G. reduced its net income for four of the last five years and lowered its net worth by $2.26 billion, or 2.7 percent. A.I.G.'s net worth at the end of 2004 was $83 billion.
