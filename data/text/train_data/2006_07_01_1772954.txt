A judge has ruled for Microsoft as part of an antitrust lawsuit brought by the founder of a tablet computer company in one of the last remaining civil lawsuits from a 1998 federal antitrust case against the company.
The lawsuit, filed a year ago by Jerrold S. Kaplan, founder of the Go Corporation, was dismissed in an opinion issued Thursday by Judge J. Frederick Motz of Federal District Court in Maryland. The judge wrote that Mr. Kaplan had the option of filing a new lawsuit at a future date.
