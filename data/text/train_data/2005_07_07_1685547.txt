Boeing agreed to pay its new chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., a total compensation package that could top $53 million to wrest him away from 3M, Boeing said Wednesday.
The package essentially replaces the one that Mr. McNerney held at 3M, and to collect its full value he will have to stay at Boeing at least six years, company officials said.
