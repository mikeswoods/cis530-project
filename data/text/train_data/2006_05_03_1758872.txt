The transformation of Temple University in recent years from a commuter school to a residential campus with a more geographically diverse student population is stimulating private investment in one of the city's most troubled neighborhoods.
Today, more than 8,000 students live on or near the main campus in North Philadelphia, twice as many as four years ago. About half live in housing built by the university or created by private developers on property owned by Temple.
