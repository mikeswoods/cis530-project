THE entry in the Zagat guide made the restaurant sound affordable. So did the menu posted near the door. Entrees were about $15. Even with wine, spending less than $80 for two people seemed like no problem.
But once you are seated, the waiter comes by and asks if he may bring you some San Pellegrino sparkling water. Whenever your glass is half-empty, he fills it, and he always replaces a finished bottle with a new one, at $10 apiece. By the time dinner is over, the bill has crept toward $130, all because you did not want to seem too chintzy to order a little fizzy water.
