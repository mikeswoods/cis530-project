As executives from Euronext and the NYSE Group  talked up a $10.2 billion deal to create the first trans-Atlantic exchange, a rival suitor, Deutsche Börse of Germany, said on Friday that it would continue to push to join forces with Euronext.
The NYSE Group announced late Thursday that it would acquire Euronext, creating an electronic trading giant with a market capitalization of about $20 billion. By accepting the offer, Euronext rebuffed Deutsche Börse's attempts to create an all-European champion.
