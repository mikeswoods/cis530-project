Norah Jones fans who wanted to see the singer perform live last summer had little trouble finding tickets. Although she was touring to promote the platinum-selling album ''Feels Like Home,'' Ms. Jones sold an average of only two-thirds of the tickets available for each show, according to Pollstar, which tracks the pop concert business.
She was not the only artist staring out at empty seats. For Incubus, a rock band that had done well in 2003, ''sales were brutal,'' according to Randy Phillips, chief executive of AEG Live, the promoter that booked most of the dates. Even Simon and Garfunkel, whose reunion was the sixth-highest-selling tour in 2003, took in about half as much money a show last year. ''Last summer,'' Mr. Phillips said, ''was a disaster.''
