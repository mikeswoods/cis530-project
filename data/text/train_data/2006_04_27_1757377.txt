TiVo perfected digital video recording and in the process shook up the TV industry. In the years since its debut, much has changed: prime-time shows are starting and stopping at odd times, commercials are designed to be watched while fast-forwarding, and an army of competing companies and devices have crowded the market.
One major downside to TiVo until now has been that its devices can record only one show at a time. This week TiVo is introducing its new dual-tuner recorders, one with an 80-hour capacity ($99 after $150 rebate, direct from tivo.com) and another with 180 hours ($199 after $150 rebate).
