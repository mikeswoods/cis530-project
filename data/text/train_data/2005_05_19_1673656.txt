L-3 Communications, a military technology company, is in advanced talks to buy the Titan Corporation, the military contractor, for roughly $1.8 billion, executives involved in the negotiations said yesterday.
The talks come less than a year after Lockheed Martin broke off a deal to buy Titan because of charges that Titan was involved in a foreign bribery scheme. Titan has since pleaded guilty and paid $28.5 million to settle the criminal and civil charges.
