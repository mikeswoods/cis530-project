Sony's video game unit said yesterday that Ken Kutaragi, the father of the PlayStation game console, would no longer run its day-to-day affairs. The move comes just weeks after Mr. Kutaragi's latest creation, the PlayStation 3, hit the market following a year of delays and technical problems.
Mr. Kutaragi, who is a celebrity among consumers in Japan and has had a sometimes stormy relationship with his superiors at Sony, will remain chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment. He will also become chairman but will give up control of daily operations. Starting today, that job will belong to Kazuo Hirai, who has been running the game unit's American division.
