ABOUT 10 years ago, a man named J. Richard Fredericks, who focused on commercial banking during a career in the securities business, made an interesting observation. ''Banking is essential to a modern economy,'' he said. ''But banks are not.''
Recent events have made Mr. Fredericks look prescient. The most obvious development has been Wal-Mart's request for federal permission to enter the banking business. Although the company says it wants permission only to operate a quasibank -- known as an industrial loan company -- in order to save money on credit card processing, America's smaller banks worry that eventually the big retailer will eat their lunch.
