Brazil said on Tuesday that it was close to completing an agreement with Abbott Laboratories that would almost halve the price it pays for Kaletra, a drug used to treat AIDS patients.
The pending agreement, which would lower the drug's price to 63 cents a pill from $1.17, comes after months of negotiations and stern warnings from Brazil that it would disregard Abbott's patent and make a generic version of Kaletra domestically if the company did not lower the price to a level it deemed affordable.
