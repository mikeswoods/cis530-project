THE American International Group is no Enron. Of that we can be sure. A.I.G., after all, is a real company with global operations, generating genuine profits from a variety of financial enterprises. As companies go, Enron was all smoke and mirrors; A.I.G. is substance.
Moreover, until five minutes ago, A.I.G. was run by Maurice R. Greenberg, a brilliant man who was both visionary and micromanager, a far cry from the know-nothing that Ken Lay, Enron's former chief executive, claims to be, now that his trial looms.
