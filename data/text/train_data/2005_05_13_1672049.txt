Microsoft said Thursday that it would enter the consumer antivirus business as part of a subscription service that it will offer next year.
Microsoft said a companywide trial of the service, called Windows OneCare, would begin next week. The service will include virus and spyware protection as well as PC backup and performance-enhancing functions for Windows PC's.
