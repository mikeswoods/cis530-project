Oil prices slipped Tuesday on signs that the direction of Hurricane Rita was shifting away from America's energy heartland and OPEC formally agreed to lift all restrictions on its oil sales for the next three months, in a move aimed at further reassuring markets still on edge over the security of energy supplies.
On Monday, energy prices surged 7 percent, to $67 a barrel, on worries that Hurricane Rita was headed for the main oil-producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico. The latest predictions somewhat eased those fears but still suggested that the hurricane could affect offshore facilities and refineries along the coast of Texas. Another shift in the storm late Tuesday night pushed oil prices up in after-hours trading.
