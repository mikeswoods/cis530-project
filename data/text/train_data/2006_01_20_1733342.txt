The United States and Mexico agreed on Thursday to phase out American duties on Mexican cement imports, a move aimed at easing cement shortages caused by a building boom in Asia and rising demand for cement to rebuild after Hurricane Katrina.
The agreement would reduce duties on Mexican imports to $3 a metric ton, from $26, but limit imports to three million tons a year in the Southern states for the next three years, according to a statement from the Commerce Department. After that, all duties and quotas would be ended.
