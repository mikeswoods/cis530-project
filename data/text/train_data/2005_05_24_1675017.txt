The pirate statue had 14 days to leave Massapequa, N.Y. And leave it did.
The owner of the six-foot-tall resin figure recently took it to the QuikDrop store on Long Island to have it photographed and put up for auction on eBay for 14 days. An online bidder from Utah paid $750 and the store's workers packed it and were preparing to send it last night.
