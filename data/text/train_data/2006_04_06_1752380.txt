Two years ago, Marty Dragutsky was downsized out of a job selling pharmaceuticals. That startling event forced him to finally take account of his finances. After 30 years in sales, the last 17 years with a division of Abbott Laboratories, Mr. Dragutsky had accumulated a nest egg of nearly half a million dollars in his 401(k) account -- nearly all of it in Abbott Labs stock.
Mr. Dragutsky, 59, of Gainesville, Fla., knew that would not be enough to sustain him and his family through retirement. He had a brokerage account with PaineWebber but rarely used it. So he turned to Davis, Monk & Company, a Gainesville financial services firm, which urged him to diversify.
