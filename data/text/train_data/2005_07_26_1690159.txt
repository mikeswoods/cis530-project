In a sign that the regulatory scrutiny of the insurance industry is not abating, RenaissanceRe Holdings, a Bermuda-based reinsurer that recently restated three years of earnings, disclosed yesterday that the Securities and Exchange Commission has advised its chief executive, James N. Stanard, that he may soon face a civil complaint.
The company also said regulators had recommended the filing of enforcement proceedings against Michael W. Cash, a senior vice president in RenaissanceRe's specialty reinsurance unit who resigned on July 11. Mr. Cash left the company after refusing to accept a subpoena from the S.E.C. seeking his testimony about the company's restatement. Mr. Cash is a Bermudian citizen.
