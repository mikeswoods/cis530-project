THE plain fact is that when it comes to measuring how much the American economy produces and who gets what share of the pie, the federal government's most celebrated statistic -- the gross domestic product -- leaves something to be desired.
The G.D.P. is useful, as far as it goes. It tells us how much value -- often called national income -- is generated each year from the production of goods and services in the United States. The G.D.P. also breaks out how much of that income goes into profits and how much into wages and salaries.
