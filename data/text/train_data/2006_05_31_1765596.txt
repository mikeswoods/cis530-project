Kim Woo Choong, whose career as the rags-to-riches founder of the Daewoo Group ended in a corporate fraud scandal, was sentenced on Tuesday to 10 years in prison and ordered to forfeit 21.4 trillion won ($23 billion).
The Seoul Central District Court said on Tuesday that Mr. Kim's conviction on charges that included accounting fraud and embezzlement should serve as a warning to others.
