The Russian government will go ahead with a planned merger of Gazprom, the country's natural gas monopoly, and Rosneft, a state-controlled oil company, but the new state energy giant will not include the prize oil fields from the embattled Yukos oil company.
Instead Yuganskneftegas, which controls the former Yukos oil fields that pump one million barrels a day, will be run as a stand-alone company, Gazprom and Rosneft officials said on Wednesday.
