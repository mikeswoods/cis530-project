The Intel Corporation went on the offensive on Tuesday, showing off a new design for powerful, energy-efficient processors that it hopes will help it gain back the market share it has lost to its rival, Advanced Micro Devices.
Intel, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, demonstrated its latest chip technology just days after it disclosed it would miss its first-quarter financial targets because of a slowdown in demand and a slight loss in market share.
