IT'S something of a mystery why the huge and presumably powerful public pension funds in this country have been so loath to investigate whether they have been hurt by their consultants' conflicted loyalties. After all, the biases in these organizations are of enough concern to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it has conducted an industrywide investigation of pension consultants and may recommend enforcement actions against some of them.
Well, last week, the ice finally began to crack on this important issue. The board of the Public School Teachers' Pension and Retirement Fund of Chicago is reviewing a proposal to conduct a comprehensive conflict-of-interest audit of its investment consultant, Mercer Inc., a unit of Marsh & McLennan. The fund has $10.3 billion in assets and has been a Mercer client since 1990.
