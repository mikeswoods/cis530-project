Randy Falco, the president of the NBC Universal Television Group, is in talks to leave his position as the No. 2 executive at the television group to take a senior operating role at AOL, Time Warner's Internet subsidiary, according to executives briefed on the move.
The move to shake up the top ranks of the two big media companies is expected to be announced as soon as this week. But it was unclear last night, the executives said, whether Mr. Falco, 52, would hold the title of president or chief executive at AOL, and what position Jonathan F. Miller, AOL's chairman and chief executive, would maintain after the move.
