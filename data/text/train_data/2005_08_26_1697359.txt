A former Lehman Brothers investment manager pleaded guilty in federal court yesterday to conspiring to launder $11 million in drug proceeds for the governor of a state in Mexico who was a fugitive from justice there.
Consuelo Marquez, who worked as an investment representative at Lehman from 1995 to 2000, was a financial adviser to Mario Villanueva Madrid when he was the governor of Quintana Roo on the Yucat√°n Peninsula. During his tenure, Mr. Villanueva was investigated by the Mexican federal police on suspicion that he was using state law enforcement officers to protect shipments of Colombian cocaine that were moving across his state, a major transit point on the drug route to the United States.
