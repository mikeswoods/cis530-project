Nearly three years ago, someone claiming to be the wife of the hedge fund manager David Einhorn contacted his phone company and, using his wife's Social Security number, opened an online account.
The caller directed the phone company to send copies of Mr. Einhorn's home telephone bills to an AOL account, according to letters written by Mr. Einhorn that he provided to The New York Times.
