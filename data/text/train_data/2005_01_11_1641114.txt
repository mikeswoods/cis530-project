Thom Calandra, a former columnist for CBS MarketWatch.com, will pay more than $540,000 to settle federal regulators' charges that he used an investment newsletter to pump up the price of penny stocks he owned before selling them.
In a complaint filed yesterday, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Mr. Calandra of using The Calandra Report, an Internet investment newsletter, to promote the thinly traded stocks of 23 companies, without disclosing that he owned them, and then went on to sell them for a gain of more than $405,000. Mr. Calandra also failed to tell his readers that he received heavily discounted shares in two mining companies when he recommended them in the newsletter before selling them for a large profit, the complaint said.
