Philip F. Murtaugh, the General Motors executive who turned the company's operations in China into one of G.M.'s few successes in recent years, has unexpectedly resigned from the automaker, citing personal reasons, people with knowledge of his decision said on Wednesday.
G.M. officials declined to comment on Mr. Murtaugh's plans. But his departure coincides with growing competitiveness and reduced profitability for all automakers in the Chinese market, as well as an effort by G.M. executives in Detroit to unite the company's global operations.
