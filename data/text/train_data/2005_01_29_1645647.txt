Molson shareholders overwhelmingly approved a $3.4 billion merger with the Adolph Coors Company on Friday, securing a deal that appeared to be in jeopardy earlier this month.
The deal was approved by 80.2 percent of Molson's Class A shareholders; 84.3 percent of its Class B holders voted in favor at a hotel in downtown Montreal. The support of the Class A holders, most of them not members of the Molson family, had been in doubt.
