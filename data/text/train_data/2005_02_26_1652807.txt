Riggs National, the embattled Washington banking company, agreed to pay an unusual $8 million settlement to resolve a Spanish legal action related to its dealings with Chile's former dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet. In addition, Robert L. Allbritton, the bank's chief executive, and his father, Joe L. Allbritton, former chief executive and its controlling shareholder, will pay another $1 million.
The money will go to a foundation in Spain that will distribute it to victims of the Pinochet regime or their families, said Sam Buffone, a lawyer with Ropes & Gray in Washington who represents some of the victims.
