Let's face it: we're in love with the idea of secret location trackers. In ''The Da Vinci Code,'' the bad guys slap a location-tracking button onto Tom Hanks's clothing. In ''The Matrix,'' a location-tracking scorpion robot crawls into Keanu Reeves's abdomen. In ''Total Recall,'' a tracking device is implanted into Arnold Schwarzenegger's nose.
Many parents may have fleetingly harbored the fantasy of equipping their children with such tracking devices (though perhaps not through their noses or navels). You could find out instantly where your teenager was, or find out that your middle-schooler didn't come home after school because of a rendezvous you forgot about.
