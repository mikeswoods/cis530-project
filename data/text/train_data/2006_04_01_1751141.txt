In a rare victory for the federal pension insurance program, the government says it will stop going after the assets of the industrialist Ira L. Rennert because it has been assured that Mr. Rennert will keep a disputed steelworkers' pension plan going. That means that Mr. Rennert's $185 million estate in the Hamptons is safe.
Mr. Rennert's company, the Renco Group, has owned the pension plan's sponsor, WCI Steel, since 1988. The steel company, based in Warren, Ohio, went bankrupt in 2003, and in the jockeying over who would bring it out of bankruptcy, the pension fund seemed at risk of being abandoned.
