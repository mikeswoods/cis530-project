Nearly five years after it opened in an old Guinness brewery building, Media Lab Europe, a research institution set up during the height of the dot-com boom by the Irish government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, will close because of a chronic shortfall in financing.
Media Lab Europe failed to attract enough private-sector sponsorships, deals under which a company would typically pay 160,000 euros ($209,000) to gain access to the lab's research in areas as diverse as online communities and electronic musical instruments played with hand gestures.
