MARILYN FREEMAN fondly remembers being treated like royalty by the American Airlines crew on her honeymoon flight to Hawaii 30 years ago. Just out of college, she and her husband, Gary, were pampered with Champagne and personal attention from the flight attendants. ''It was a privileged situation,'' she recalled.
These days, she said, her biggest treat on business trips is finding an empty seat next to her. And Mrs. Freeman, 51, the co-founder of an investment firm in Stamford, Conn., is similarly amazed when flights arrive or depart on schedule. Flying in the current airline environment, she said, ''isn't pretty; it isn't fun; it isn't pleasant.''
