FREQUENT FLIERS' FAVORITES Business travelers overwhelmingly prefer using the major legacy carriers, but Southwest Airlines, the low-cost carrier, nevertheless ranks No. 3 on the list of Top 5 airlines, after Delta and American but before United And Northwest. That's according to the 2005 National Business Travel Monitor by YPB&R/Yankelovitch Partners. Top criteria for ranking an airline: on-time departure record (cited by 92 percent), in-flight service (91 percent), legroom (88 percent) and frequency of upgrades (72 percent).
NEW NICHE IN AIR TRAVEL JetBlue Airways is about to take initial delivery of a fleet of Embraer 190 jets, which seat 100 and are seen as occupying a niche between regional jets and full-size airliners. JetBlue is expected to begin flying eight of the Embraer 190's in November, augmenting its current fleet of 77 Airbus A320's, which each seat 156. The Embraer 190's are economical to operate and will enable JetBlue to serve smaller airports, Dave Barger, JetBlue's president and chief operating officer, said last week.
