The FPL Group announced its $11 billion acquisition of Constellation Energy on Monday, one of the largest such transactions in the history of the American electricity industry, with a focus on using two decidedly retro energy sources, coal and nuclear power, to make the deal work.
Lewis Hay III, the chairman of FPL, who will become the chief executive of the new concern, spoke in a telephone interview about the need for greater fuel diversity. The combined company, which is to take the name Constellation, will become the nation's third-largest provider of nuclear-fueled electricity, after Exelon and Entergy, and one of the largest suppliers of coal-fired power.
