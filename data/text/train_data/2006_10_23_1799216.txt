Garth H. Drabinsky, the Canadian producer of ''The Phantom of the Opera'' and ''Ragtime,'' plans to start a new reality TV show called ''Triple Sensation,'' which aims to seek out young stars who can sing, act and dance.
One thing is for certain for the show: it won't include any field trips to Broadway. That is because Mr. Drabinsky has been a fugitive from American justice since failing to appear at a federal court in New York in 1999 on fraud charges related to the bankruptcy of his company, Livent. If he crosses the border, he could be arrested.
