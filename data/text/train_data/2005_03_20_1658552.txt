In Enron's final weeks, years of incompetence, mismanagement and crime finally emerged into public view. But behind the scenes, a desperate -- and at times farcical -- effort was unfolding to avert what proved to be its inevitable destruction.
A new book, ''Conspiracy of Fools: A True Story'' by Kurt Eichenwald, provides a detailed look at Enron's rise and fall, including those crucial last days. Following is the second of two sets of excerpts from the book, published by the Broadway Books imprint of Random House. In the first excerpts, published last week, signs of significant trouble at Enron emerged, including questions about whether an off-the-books entity named Chewco had been accounted for properly. Public rumblings of problems had set Enron's stock price into a tailspin and put its survival in question.
