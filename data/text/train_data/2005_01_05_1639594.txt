VIACOM has a lot riding on the executive who comes in to run its stagnant Paramount film studio. Whether or not that executive is Brad Grey, the talent manager who is reportedly close to a deal, the change opens the possibility that the studio's profit contribution to Viacom could grow.
That may be why Viacom's widely held Class B shares have risen nearly 1 percent since Monday, while the overall market has declined. Though the increase was relatively small, it was better than the increases at the other media companies.
