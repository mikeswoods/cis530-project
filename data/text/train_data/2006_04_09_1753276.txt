THE power of sunlight as an antiseptic will be put to the test in the coming months, as the Securities and Exchange Commission completes its most significant overhaul in 14 years of the rules governing what companies must disclose about their compensation of top executives.
Tomorrow, the commission closes the window for companies and experts to comment about the new rules, which it has promised to enact in time for the 2007 proxy season. If adopted as proposed, they would require disclosure of far more details about how compensation committees set pay for top corporate officers. They also would force companies to provide more comprehensive information about the perks, retirement packages and post-employment compensation they award to companies' most senior employees.
