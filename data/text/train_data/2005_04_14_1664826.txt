Freddie Mac, the nation's second-largest buyer of mortgages, said yesterday that it had unknowingly bought a small number of mortgages that had ''unacceptable refinance'' terms and then sold them in securities offerings to investors.
The company said an investigation had discovered that a California broker sold borrowers mortgages with above-market interest rates and then provided financial incentives to encourage quick refinancing. The broker, who was not identified, profited from the fees from the quick turnover.
