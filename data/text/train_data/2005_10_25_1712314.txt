Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, a boutique investment bank that has worked on some of the nation's largest corporate bankruptcies, is negotiating to be sold to the Orix Corporation of Japan for more than $500 million, executives involved in the talks said yesterday.
A deal to sell Houlihan, which is based in Los Angeles, would end the independence of a firm that has made its name advising small and midsize corporations on mergers and acquisitions and advising companies and creditors on restructuring efforts as part of bankruptcies.
