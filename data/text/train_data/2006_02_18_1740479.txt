AMERICANS were handed -- some might say had forced upon them -- control of their retirement funds 32 years ago with the creation of the Individual Retirement Account. The 401(k), invented four years later, cemented the idea that individuals must take more responsibility for their financial future.
Now Americans may be pushed to take more control of another aspect of their finances, their health care spending. They may face more choices and more direct payment of costs. They will be urged to set up Health Savings Accounts, a 401(k) for medical bills.
