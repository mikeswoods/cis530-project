Nortel Networks said on Wednesday that it narrowed its third-quarter loss to $105 million, from $259 million a year earlier, helped by increased sales of Internet-related products.
The company, a maker of telecommunications equipment based in Brampton, Ontario, said revenue in the period rose to $2.66 billion, from $2.18 billion, as Internet equipment sales increased 41 percent, to $754 million.
