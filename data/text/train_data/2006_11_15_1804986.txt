By the time the crowd began arriving in Rockefeller Center last Wednesday for the big auction at Christie's, rain had already been falling in New York for 19 consecutive hours. It was one of those blustery rains for which umbrellas were no match, so the assembled art lovers were left to peel off their damp overcoats in Christie's lobby and wait in a long coat-check line.
Once inside, a few hundred of the attendees were shunted off to one of two side rooms, where they would watch the auction on a video screen, because the 750 seats in the main room -- the James Christie Room -- weren't nearly enough for the crowd.
