The Cleveland Clinic's board has agreed to take steps to address concerns about potential conflicts of interest that have dogged the institution and its doctors for more than a year.
The clinic, a nonprofit medical research and treatment center, said yesterday that the new measures would give the board of trustees a greater role in evaluating industry relationships that might bias research or patient care. The monitoring will examine outside ties not only of doctors but of anyone working at the clinic and of the trustees themselves.
