In a bitter split, United Airlines' creditors, along with some banks and unions, have joined the federal government in opposing a deal in which United would terminate its pilots' pension plan and offer the pilots equity in the airline and other sweeteners in exchange.
The showdown will come in a federal bankruptcy court in Chicago tomorrow, as the pilots are set to finish voting on the deal, which United reached with the union leadership last month.
