A Senate panel heard testimony on Wednesday that the Future Combat Systems, the costliest Army program ever conceived, faces huge technological hurdles and the potential for multibillion-dollar cost overruns.
Paul L. Francis of the acquisition and sourcing management group of the Government Accountability Office told the Senate Armed Services Committee that building the first part of the program, which aims to rebuild the United States Army as a networked force, will cost at least $108 billion. He said that sum would represent only a down payment, enough to cover about a third of the forces that the Army wants to equip.
