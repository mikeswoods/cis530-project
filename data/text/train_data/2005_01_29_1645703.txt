Kaiser Permanente, one of the nation's largest managed care organizations, has ordered its pharmacies to stop dispensing Bextra, an arthritis and pain drug made by Pfizer that some tests have indicated may increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
Bextra is in the same class of drugs as another Pfizer painkiller, Celebrex, which has also been found to pose cardiac risks at high doses, and as Vioxx, the drug that Merck pulled from the market last fall after its own tests disclosed cardiac risks.
