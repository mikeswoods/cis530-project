As federal prosecutors sought on Wednesday to portray Richard M. Scrushy as a ''pied piper'' who led more than a dozen executives at HealthSouth to a sweeping $2.7 billion accounting fraud, defense lawyers pointed to another HealthSouth executive as the ''big rat'' responsible for the wrongdoing.
Employing a folksy and colorful Southern style that he has used throughout this nearly four-month criminal trial, Jim Parkman, one of the defense lawyers, told the jury in closing arguments that Mr. Scrushy was a victim of a far-ranging conspiracy by his underlings. Mr. Parkman even displayed a poster-size cartoon of a rat with a piece of cheese to attack the credibility of one of the government's main witnesses, William T. Owens, a former HealthSouth chief financial officer who testified that Mr. Scrushy was behind the fraud.
