I HAVE a nose for scents. It's something I've developed after years in the fragrance industry. I can sniff out a compound in a perfume that most other people couldn't detect. But there is a catch: I can't turn it off. My sensitive nose is in the permanent ''on'' position -- even when I travel.
We all know what it's like to be downwind from the lady at the opera who slathered too much tuberose on herself before the performance. You feel as if you're going to pass out.
