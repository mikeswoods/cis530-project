Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, which has experienced a plunge in sales, has tentatively arranged a $225 million loan to refinance bank debt that was frozen after the company ran into financial problems, a person briefed on the negotiations said yesterday.
The person said that the deal was likely to be disclosed later in the week and that the amount of the loan might be changed before details were completed. The lenders are to be Credit Suisse First Boston and Silver Point Finance, a subsidiary of Silver Point Capital, a hedge fund based in Greenwich, Conn.
