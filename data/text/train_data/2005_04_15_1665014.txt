A federal judge in Indianapolis upheld Eli Lilly's patent on Zyprexa, a treatment for schizophrenia that was among the top-selling drugs in the United States last year, with $2.4 billion in sales.
Lilly had sued three generic drug companies to protect its patent, after the generic companies claimed that the patent was invalid because Zyprexa is too similar to other chemical compounds whose patents have already expired. In a 224-page ruling, Judge Richard L. Young of Federal District Court backed Lilly's position, finding Zyprexa different from the other compounds and worthy of protection.
