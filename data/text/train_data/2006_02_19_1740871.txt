YOU can divide investors into two camps these days. There are those who think that the stock market will return so little that it doesn't pay to take any risk for now. And there are those who think that the market will return so little that you must embrace risk if you want any meaningful gains.
Who is correct? Both sides have compelling arguments, but for the moment, the risk takers are finding it easier to persuade the investing public.
