PREMIUM-CABIN IMPROVEMENTS -- Upping the ante once again in premium-class cabin luxury, British Airways introduced in London yesterday what it called its ''next-generation business-class flat-bed.'' The new bed in British Air's Club World business class is 25 percent wider than the current beds. The newly designed seats fold out to a six-foot-long bed, and have redesigned locker and storage spaces. The new amenity, which will cost about $100 million, will be on the first aircraft by the end of this month, and will be rolled out through the long-haul fleet of 57 Boeing 747's and 43 Boeing 777's within 18 months. Business-class capacity will also be increased. ''Our premium cabins are our most profitable segment, and we are reconfiguring our aircraft to increase ClubWorld capacity by 9 percent, moving from 38 to 52 seats on some of our Boeing 747 aircraft,'' said Willie Walsh, the chief executive. Last month, Singapore Airlines announced a $360 million improvement project for its Boeing 777-300ER long-haul fleet. It said certain features of those cabins would be incorporated into the long-delayed A380 superjumbo aircraft, which Singapore will be the first to fly once deliveries begin.
LOCKING CHECKED BAGS -- More than 70 percent of adult air travelers are not aware they can lock their checked bags, according to a new study. The number of checked bags has risen by as much as 30 percent after security restrictions about carrying on gels, liquids and other substances went into effect in August. The study, by Harris Interactive, was commissioned by Travel Sentry, a company that developed a standard system for bag combination locks that can be opened only by their owners or by government inspectors with master keys. There are various versions of the government-approved locks, either free-standing or incorporated into baggage, being sold at more than 100 retail distributors, Travel Sentry says. A competitor, Safe Skies, also markets a line of government-approved locks.
