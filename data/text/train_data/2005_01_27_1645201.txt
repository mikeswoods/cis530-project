EVEN as the British unit of Volkswagen prepared yesterday to confront the creators of a fake Volkswagen commercial circulating online, executives there said they were worried that the incident would not be the last. Rather, they said, it may set the table for more hoaxes and brand confusion.
''The difficulty is, of course, that the general public may not know who is behind what they see on the Internet,'' said Paul Buckett, the head of press and public relations at Volkswagen Group U.K. in London. ''And in the future it may not be easy to take legal action to defend ourselves. That's not just for Volkswagen, of course, but for any company or individual.''
