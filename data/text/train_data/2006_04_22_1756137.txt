A state court jury in South Texas dealt Merck another setback yesterday afternoon, awarding $32 million in damages to the family of Leonel Garza, a 71-year-old retiree who died of a heart attack in 2001 after briefly taking the painkiller Vioxx.
Texas laws that cap punitive damages will automatically reduce the award to $7.75 million. Still, the verdict is a major disappointment for Merck, because Mr. Garza had a long history of heart disease, including a previous heart attack, and took Vioxx for less than a month before he died.
