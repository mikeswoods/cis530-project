Aon, the world's second-largest insurance broker, is close to a settlement with the attorneys general of New York, Connecticut and Illinois that would end investigations into hidden incentive payments that it received from insurance companies. A settlement could be announced as early as today.
Aon, based in Chicago, has agreed to pay about $190 million over several years, people close to the case said. The money will be designated as restitution to commercial insurance customers of Aon around the country who paid it to provide unbiased advice on obtaining the best coverage at the lowest prices.
