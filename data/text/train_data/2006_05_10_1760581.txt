As a college and professional quarterback, Roger Staubach was an athlete with a flair for the dramatic, but in his 25-year career in commercial real estate, he has built his approach around a fairly unheralded side of the business: representing tenants rather than landlords.
In New York, Mr. Staubach has consolidated the Staubach Company's two offices under one leader: the broker Peter B. Hennessy. He said the move signals an ambitious crusade on the part of the brokerage firm, which is based in Dallas, to increase its New York City market share in the next five years to 20 percent, after hitting 5.5 percent in 2005.
