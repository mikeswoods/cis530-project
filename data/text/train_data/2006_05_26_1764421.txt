Google and Dell have reached an agreement to install Google software on millions of new Dell computers over the next few years, Google's chief executive said on Thursday.
The executive, Eric E. Schmidt, said the arrangement meant that Google's search toolbar would appear on the screens of new Dell systems, and that Dell users would be directed to a Web page branded by the two companies.
