It has been a good week to be Leon Black. In the course of just three days, Mr. Black, the enigmatic founder of the Apollo Group, a private equity firm, has struck about $37 billion worth of deals.
On Sunday, Apollo acquired Realogy, the giant real estate franchiser that owns Coldwell Banker, Century 21 and Sotheby's International Realty. That deal has now been trumped by a $27.8 billion deal yesterday for Harrah's Entertainment, the world's largest casino company. The acquisition, which includes the assumption of $10.7 billion in debt, was made in tandem with the Texas Pacific Group.
