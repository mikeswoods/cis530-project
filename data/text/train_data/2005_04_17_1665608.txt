Few former chief executives acknowledge that they miss the power of running a company. That makes the candor of Josh S. Weston -- who retired as the chairman of Automatic Data Processing in 1998, two years after he stepped down as chief executive -- particularly refreshing.
His life in retirement is busy and rewarding. He serves on the boards of J. Crew, the retailer; Gentiva Health Services, which provides nurses and health care services at home; and Russ Berrie & Company, a toy company. He also works as part of a group of business experts who advise the Pentagon.
