Facing increasing pressure from angry shareholders, the steel company Arcelor said Wednesday that it would talk to Mittal Steel, which has made a hostile bid for the company.
The discussions are not necessarily a prelude to a deal between the two companies. Arcelor has already agreed to acquire the Russian steel company Severstal for 13 billion euros ($16.7 billion) to repel the Mittal bid. Arcelor said Wednesday that it had not changed course.
