Bernie Burkholder, dressed in scuffed tennis shoes, shorts and a dirty shirt, could have been any other shell-shocked survivor of Hurricane Katrina, desperate to find enough gas to motor out of town. Mr. Burkholder stood by a badly damaged hotel here in the coastal town of Biloxi, siphoning gas from a barrel into a pair of five-gallon plastic jugs.
Mr. Burkholder, however, was not just any passer-by. He runs the hotel, and also the casino barge, that sat beached on the sand across the street as if a wayward whale had run aground. The first floor of the casino is completely gutted, most of the windows are blown out, and the hotel's top floor is so damaged that anyone looking from across the street can see clear to the other side.
