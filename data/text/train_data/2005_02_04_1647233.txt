The Food and Drug Administration said yesterday that it might permit an implantable electrical device for the treatment of epilepsy made by Cyberonics to also be marketed as a therapy for chronic depression that is resistant to other treatments.
The agency set a number of conditions on the tentative approval, and Cyberonics said it hoped to meet them before the end of May.
