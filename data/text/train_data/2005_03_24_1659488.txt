HBO and New Line Cinema said Wednesday that they would jointly acquire Newmarket Films, the independent film distributor that released ''The Passion of the Christ'' last year.
The newly restructured company, which has yet to be named, will be based in New York and distribute films made by HBO Films and New Line, which are both owned by Time Warner, executives for the two divisions said. The new company will also finance a new lineup of modestly budgeted independent films.
