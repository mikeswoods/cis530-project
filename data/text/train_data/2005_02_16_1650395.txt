Two anti-McDonald's activists convicted of libel in Britain for criticizing the company's animal rights practices, its environmental policies and the nutritional value of its food did not get a fair trial and should be compensated by the British government, a European court said Tuesday.
The two, Helen Steel, a former gardener, and David Morris, a former mailman, were ordered in 1997 to pay Â£60,000 to McDonald's after it sued them for distributing pamphlets titled ''What's Wrong With McDonald's'' in front of its London outlets. The ruling came after a trial that lasted more than 300 days and become known as McLibel. The trial still holds the record as Britain's longest, and helped fuel anti-McDonald's sentiment throughout Europe.
