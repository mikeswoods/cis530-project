Michael D. Gallagher, a senior official in the Commerce Department, and Kevin J. Martin, a commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission, have emerged as the top contenders to become the next chairman of the F.C.C., administration officials said on Wednesday.
President Bush is expected to announce his choice soon. Michael K. Powell, the current chairman, will preside over his final commission meeting on Thursday. He plans to leave the agency next week after seven and a half years, including four as chairman.
