Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, and his finance chief, Scott D. Sullivan, backed out of preliminary merger talks with Verizon Communications in 2001 to avoid having to open the company's books to outsiders, according to testimony yesterday from Mr. Sullivan.
That summer, Mr. Sullivan said, he and Mr. Ebbers were in merger talks with their counterparts at Verizon Communications. But the two sides had not yet started a due diligence process that would have allowed Verizon to inspect WorldCom's confidential accounts. According to Mr. Sullivan, Verizon's chief executive, Ivan G. Seidenberg, had told Mr. Ebbers that he wanted to announce a deal before Labor Day.
