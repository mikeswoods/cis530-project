Marvel Enterprises said yesterday that it had settled its legal battle with Stan Lee, its chairman emeritus and a co-creator of Marvel characters like Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four.
Mr. Lee sued the company in November 2002, arguing that it had failed to honor a contract promising 10 percent of profits from television and film productions like ''Spider-Man,'' ''X-Men'' and ''Hulk'' as well as from some related merchandise.
