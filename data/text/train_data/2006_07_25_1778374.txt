FOR weeks, an unusual Web site linked to the World Cup soccer tournament kept visitors guessing: Could this be real?
The site, FingerSkilz.tv, shows what appear to be close-up videos of a man's hand on a desk, using two fingers to perform soccer tricks with a wadded-up paper ''ball.'' The Brazilian-style handiwork attracted more than 180,000 unique visitors to the site, prompted widespread discussion on blogs and moved imitators to create their own ''fingerball'' videos and post them on the Web.
