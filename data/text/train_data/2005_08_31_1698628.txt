General Motors executives told financial analysts yesterday that they were making progress in their efforts to become profitable again, but that rising gas prices and continuing negotiations over labor costs were complicating the company's comeback bid.
The executives said that sales of G.M.'s large sport utility vehicles, which have been a crucial profit center, will not return to their past levels. The company is also shifting its view on gas prices. After saying for months that rising prices were not a factor in softening demand for such vehicles, they now say the prices are having an effect.
