Robert B. McCurry, who invented the concept of cash rebates while an executive at Chrysler and later became one of the most prominent Americans at a Japanese car company, died Monday at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Del. He was 83.
The cause was complications of prostate cancer, said Joseph Tetherow, a spokesman at Toyota Motor Sales, where Mr. McCurry retired as vice chairman in 1992.
