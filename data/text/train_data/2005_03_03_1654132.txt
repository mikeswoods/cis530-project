In a broad and blistering attack, federal prosecutors accused Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, of being caught in a ''perfect storm of corruption'' that led him to order deputies to commit a multibillion-dollar fraud.
''We all know money can corrupt people, power can corrupt people and pressure can corrupt people,'' William F. Johnson, an assistant United States attorney, said yesterday in the prosecution's closing arguments in the case against Mr. Ebbers in Federal District Court in Manhattan. ''Money, power and pressure all corrupted Bernard J. Ebbers to commit fraud on a billion-dollar scale.''
