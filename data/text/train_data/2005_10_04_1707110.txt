Brandywine Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust based in suburban Philadelphia, announced yesterday that it had reached an agreement to acquire Prentiss Properties Trust of Dallas in a cash, stock and debt-assumption deal that the companies said was worth a total of approximately $3.3 billion.
The transaction, which is expected to close near the end of the year or early in 2006, would transform Brandywine of Plymouth Meeting, Pa., from a real estate company with most of its assets in the mid-Atlantic region into one with significant investments in the areas of Dallas-Fort Worth; Washington, D.C.; and Austin, Tex.; as well as in California.
