On Tuesday, the 1,366 owners of the New York Stock Exchange are likely to end an era and begin a new one by voting to convert the 213-year-old nonprofit public utility into a for-profit publicly traded company. The deal will give the Big Board a verve it has lacked: it will have the currency to acquire other exchanges, the freedom to make swift decisions without waiting for a consensus among its members and the ability to act like an entrepreneur and pursue sources of faster-growing revenue.
Oddly enough, Nasdaq could not be more pleased. The all-electronic exchange, the Big Board's traditional rival, has gone through its own makeover. It has substantially improved its financial condition and acquired Instinet, one of its top rivals. Soon Nasdaq is expected to win the right to call itself an exchange, allowing it to separate from its regulator by year-end. Combined with the Big Board's project to further automate its trading, the competition -- which has always made the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry look polite -- is set to explode.
