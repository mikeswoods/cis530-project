Having declined to accept his full bonus in 15 of the last 16 years, Eugene M. Isenberg, the chairman and chief executive of Nabors Industries, an oil driller, decided that it was time to revise his pay formula -- but he will just be enriched in a different way.
Under a deal that existed until March, once Nabors had earned a 15 percent return on equity, Mr. Isenberg was entitled to 6 cents of every additional dollar of net cash flow. Last year, that would have produced a $41 million bonus for him. But Mr. Isenberg accepted just $3 million of it. For 2006, his bonus formula was cut in half, after which it will revert back to the original formula for the next three years, the company's proxy statement shows.
