Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, announced yesterday that it would merge its print and online operations, putting them under the control of L. Gordon Crovitz, who had been president of the company's online unit.
Mr. Crovitz was named publisher of The Journal and president of Dow Jones Consumer Media Group as part of a restructuring that will include cutting 20 management jobs for a savings of about $8 million a year. As part of the overhaul, Mr. Crovitz will oversee all media that reach consumers, including The Journal, The Journal Online, Barron's, Barron's Online, MarketWatch and other Web, television, video and audio properties.
