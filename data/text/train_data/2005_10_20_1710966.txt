Many digital single-lens reflex cameras outperform smaller point-and-shoot models in part because they use big advanced-imaging chips, known as A.P.S.-size sensors, which are about half the size of a single frame of conventional 35-millimeter film. Many makers of those cameras, including Nikon, get the sensors from Sony.
Now Sony has released its own camera with the A.P.S.-size sensor. But unlike other high-end cameras, the $1,000 Sony Cyber-shot DSC-R1 has an electronic viewfinder and does not offer interchangeable lenses, traits typical of less sophisticated cameras.
