Microsoft and Pfizer took coordinated legal action yesterday against two groups sending junk e-mail messages that offer illegal generic versions of Viagra, Pfizer's best-selling drug for erectile dysfunction.
The two companies filed separate lawsuits against the people behind the CanadianPharmacy site at www.cndpharmacy.com, and the operators of Pharmacy Direct at www.myepharmacydirect.com.
