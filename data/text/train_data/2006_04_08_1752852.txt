The British military company BAE Systems said Friday that it was in talks to sell its stake in Airbus to the European Aeronautic, Defense and Space Company, signaling the end of a nearly 30-year partnership that produced the world's largest passenger plane.
BAE plans to focus all its attention on the lucrative United States military market instead, and is expected to use the proceeds of the Airbus sale to make acquisitions and expand a portfolio that already includes tanks, submarines and weapons like the howitzer.
