Two private equity firms, the Texas Pacific Group and Apax Partners, are expected to announce on Monday that they will acquire Telecom Italia's controlling stake in a Greek phone company for $1.4 billion, according to two executives involved in the negotiations.
The firms have been trying to acquire Telecom Italia's 80 percent stake in the company, TIM Hellas Telecommunications, since February. Just a few weeks ago, a deal looked uncertain after exclusive talks between Telecom Italia and the two buyers ended without an agreement. Apax and Texas Pacific are expected to split ownership of the TIM Hellas stake evenly, and increase the company's presence in Greece by investing in new products and marketing.
