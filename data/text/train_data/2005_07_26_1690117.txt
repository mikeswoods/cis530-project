When Robert Gray retired in 2002 from St. John Knits, the clothing company based in Irvine, Calif., that is the largest luxury supplier to Neiman Marcus, it was as if a single thread had been pulled from a family dynasty built over 40 years.
After several seasons of diminishing profits and complaints about the company's fusty image, the rest of that dynasty unraveled yesterday as the company announced the departures of Mr. Gray's wife, Marie, the chief designer; and their daughter, Kelly, who had been creative director and a constant feature in St. John advertisements for 22 years.
