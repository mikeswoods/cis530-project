Knight Ridder, the publisher of 32 daily newspapers including The Miami Herald and The Philadelphia Inquirer, has come under fire from its largest shareholder, which yesterday demanded that the company put itself up for sale.
The attack from Private Capital Management, a Naples, Fla., money management firm, came in the form of a letter to Knight Ridder's board, which cited a 14 percent decline in the stock of the company, the nation's second-largest newspaper publisher by circulation, since board members invited Private Capital and other investors to meet with them in July.
