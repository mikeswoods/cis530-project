Europe's biggest postal service, Deutsche Post, is expected to announce a 5.5 billion euro ($6.73 billion) acquisition of Exel of Britain on Monday, according to several people involved in the negotiations, as the German company continues to expand beyond mail delivery.
Exel is the world's largest logistics provider, or contractor handling the shipping, warehousing and delivery of goods and raw materials for other corporations. Its clients include DaimlerChrysler, Volkswagen and Marks & Spencer. Deutsche Post, which loses its postal monopoly in Germany in 2007 and has been seeking to diversify, already owns the shipping company DHL.
