Five pharmaceutical companies and nine executives are facing criminal charges of conspiracy to defraud the British National Health Service, after a three-year investigation into prices of antibiotics and blood-clotting drugs.
The companies are Kent Pharmaceuticals, Norton Healthcare (now a unit of Teva Pharmaceuticals), Generics U.K., Goldshield Group and the British arm of Ranbaxy in India. The Serious Fraud Office of Britain said on Wednesday that the companies and executives were accused of fixing prices and sharing market information.
