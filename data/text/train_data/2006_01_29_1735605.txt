MY roots led me into this job in every way. All the values of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater remind me of the values that I was brought up with. They have to do with diversity, self-discipline, giving back to the community and, ultimately, touching and changing lives.
My parents made their living by doing something that they were totally passionate about, and that has always stuck with me. They owned a children's camp in the Adirondacks. It's still in the family today.
