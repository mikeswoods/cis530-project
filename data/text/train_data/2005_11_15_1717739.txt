Thomas H. Lee Partners, the private equity firm that owns more than half of Refco, the collapsed futures and commodities brokerage firm, sued former Refco executives yesterday, seeking to recover at least $245 million.
The lawsuit was filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan against Philip R. Bennett, the former chief executive of Refco who was indicted by a grand jury last week on securities fraud charges; Tone Grant, the former president of Refco; and Santo C. Maggio, the former president and chief executive of Refco Securities L.L.C., an unregulated subsidiary of Refco. The lawsuit seeks to recover a portion of the $453 million paid by three Lee funds to buy 57 percent of Refco in 2004.
