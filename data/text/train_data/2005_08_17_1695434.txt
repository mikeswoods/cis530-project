Citing high oil prices, Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, announced its smallest quarterly profit growth in four years yesterday and warned that its third-quarter earnings would fall short of analyst estimates, disappointing Wall Street.
The company said that second-quarter earnings rose 5.8 percent, to $2.8 billion, or 67 cents a share, compared with $2.7 billion, or 62 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
