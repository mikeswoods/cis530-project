On a cavernous factory floor here, where hundreds of North Korean women diligently cut and sewed women's jackets on Monday, a South Korean businessman seemed to have found an answer to China: wages of 26 cents an hour.
''Kaesong has more advantages than Vietnam, China or Guatemala,'' Hwang Woo Seung, president of the Shinwon Ebenezer Company, said, citing other countries where his company produces clothes. ''We opened here last March and we are already starting to build another factory here twice the size of this one.''
