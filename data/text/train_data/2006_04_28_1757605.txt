Scott C. Dettmer has seen booms before.
He and five other lawyers started Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian in 1995. Soon, it and other Silicon Valley law firms were lifted by the explosive growth in technology. By 2000, his firm had grown to 130 lawyers. Then the downturn hit and the firm, based in Menlo Park, Calif., shrank to fewer than 90 lawyers by 20002.
