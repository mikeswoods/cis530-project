Nortel Networks, which is still sorting out its financial statements after disclosing irregularities, said Thursday that Peter Currie would become its chief financial officer next month. It will be the second time he has held the post.
Mr. Currie will succeed William R. Kerr, who took the position last spring after the dismissal of several executives over accounting problems.
