The government moved in bankruptcy court late Thursday to oppose an agreement that United Airlines recently struck with its pilots' union on the looming termination of the pilots' pension plan.
In a motion filed in federal bankruptcy court in Chicago, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation accused United of attempting to circumvent the federal pension law with the agreement, and of offering its active pilots relief ''at the expense of the federal government, its other employees and creditors.''
