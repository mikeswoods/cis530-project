Louis Cona, the publisher of Vanity Fair, will leave his post to be the new publisher of The New Yorker, Condé Nast Publications announced yesterday. Mr. Cona will take over for David Carey, who Condé Nast said Wednesday would run a new group that includes a business magazine and Web site.
Alan Katz, the publisher of Cargo, will take over the publisher's job at Vanity Fair. Both changes are to take effect next month.
