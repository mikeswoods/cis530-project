While snaking cables are still a long way from becoming the buggy whips of the 21st century, a Silicon Valley technology company recently said that it had developed a wireless technology that might hasten their obsolescence.
Conventional wired networks that link devices like personal computers to one another and to the Internet have always been the fastest and most reliable connections. And even as high-speed wireless networking, most often dependent on Wi-Fi standards, has become increasingly popular in recent years, electronics specialists agree that the convenience comes at the cost of slower transmission speeds and less reliability.
