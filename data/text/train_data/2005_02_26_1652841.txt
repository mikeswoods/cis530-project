In a dramatic move by the defense, Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom accused of fraud, conspiracy and filing false financial reports, has indicated that he may testify in his own defense next week.
One of Mr. Ebbers's lawyers, Brian Heberlig, told Judge Barbara S. Jones of Federal District Court about the defense team's ''good faith'' intention in a hearing yesterday. Mr. Heberlig said ''there is a very high probability'' that Mr. Ebbers would take the stand on Monday, according to a court transcript.
