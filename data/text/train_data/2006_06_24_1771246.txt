Once the purview of fashion aficionados seeking deals on power suits and Prada boots, consignment stores have diversified. Now, just about anyone can find what they are looking for, be it clothes for children and teenagers, wedding dresses, men's wear, plus-size garments, furs, jewelry, formal wear and even sneakers.
With just four months between her engagement and wedding this month, Renee Salomon of Chicago did not have time to order a gown and wait for it to be made. So she found I Do Designer Bridal Consignment, a consignment store in Chicago, where she paid $1,600 for a Vera Wang A-line that would retail for about $5,000 new. Sure, her dress had been down the aisle before, but it fit her size 12 frame, whereas most off-the-rack dresses were sample gowns that were too small.
