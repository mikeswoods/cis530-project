It has become the icon for an era of excess: the precipitate collapse of Enron, played out over the final weeks of 2001. Now, Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's former chairman, faces federal charges that he lied about the company's financial state in those weeks; his criminal trial is scheduled to begin next January.
A new book, ''Conspiracy of Fools: A True Story'' by Kurt Eichenwald, a reporter for The New York Times, provides a behind-the-scenes look at Enron's rise and fall, including those crucial final days before its demise. The narrative was reconstructed through more than a thousand hours of interviews and thousands of documents, including records of secret witness statements to law enforcement officials. Following is Part 1 of excerpts from the book, which will be published tomorrow by the Broadway Books imprint of Random House; Part 2 of the excerpts will appear next week in Sunday Business.
