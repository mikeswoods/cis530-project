Ford Motor, acknowledging for a second time that fuel tanks in some of its large sedans pose an increased risk of explosion in rear-end collisions, offered Wednesday to provide protective fire shields to owners of Lincoln Town Car stretch limousines.
Ford will not offer the fire shields to the millions of individual owners who drive cars with the same fuel system, saying the problem is specific to the limousines. Safety advocates have called on the automaker to recall the three million Ford vehicles that have the same fuel system, which was built into recent models of the Town Car, Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis.
