While city and state officials sought to mitigate the coming loss of the corporate headquarters of May Department Stores, shoppers and residents speculated about the fate of a store that has been a fixture downtown.
Federated Department Stores, which owns the Bloomingdale's and Macy's chains, announced on Monday that it would pay about $11 billion for May, which is based here and employs about 6,000 people in the area, both in corporate offices and at chains like Famous-Barr and Lord & Taylor. While the headquarters will be merged with Federated's offices in Cincinnati and New York and some job cuts are expected, Federated did not offer any specifics yesterday. The company did say it would maintain St. Louis as the headquarters for one division.
