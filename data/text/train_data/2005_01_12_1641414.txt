With residential values rising and tourists swarming, shoppers filled stores in large numbers last year. In turn, retail rents were up strongly in most parts of Manhattan last year, according to real estate executives.
''Last year was the best for retail real estate since 1999,'' said Faith H. Consolo, vice chairwoman of Garrick-Aug, a brokerage firm specializing in retail spaces. ''Two thousand one, 2002 and 2003 were a struggle; there were fewer deals and the transactions took longer. But the first quarter of 2004 got off to a jump start and never slowed down.''
