The nation's three big makers of implantable heart devices all said late yesterday that they had received subpoenas from the Department of Justice, which has apparently begun an investigation into whether any of the companies offered illegal payments or other inducements to doctors to use their products.
The three companies, Medtronic, the Guidant Corporation and St. Jude Medical, all said that they had received subpoenas from the United States attorney in Boston.
