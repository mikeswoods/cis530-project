Duke Power met with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission employees for three hours on Monday to discuss the costs and schedule for something no one in this country has done in decades: seek permission to build a nuclear power plant.
The company, a division of Duke Energy, said that it was considering three reactor designs and that it would need a plant in 10 to 15 years to serve the Piedmont region of the Carolinas.
