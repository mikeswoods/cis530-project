SHORTLY after I began teaching, more than 30 years ago, three friends in different cities independently sent me the same New Yorker cartoon depicting a woman introducing a man to a friend at a party. ''Mary, I'd like you to meet Marty Thorndecker,'' she began. ''He's an economist, but he's really very nice.''
Cartoons are data. That people find them amusing usually tells us something about reality. Curious about what drove responses to the economist cartoon, I began asking about the disappointed looks that appeared on people's faces when they first discovered I was an economist. Invariably they mentioned unpleasant memories of an introductory economics course. ''There were all those incomprehensible graphs,'' was a common refrain.
