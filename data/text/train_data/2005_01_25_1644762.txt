General Motors and Fiat will conclude settlement talks over their complex and fractured alliance on Feb. 1, the two companies said Monday. What happens on Feb. 2 remains to be seen.
The companies are locked in a standoff over Fiat's struggling automotive business. Under the terms of a broad partnership agreement struck in 2000, Fiat negotiated the right, which went into effect on Monday, to sell its auto business to G.M., with the right lasting through the decade.
