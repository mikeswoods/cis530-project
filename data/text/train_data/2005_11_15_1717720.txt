In January a group of Microsoft researchers set out to discover how much computing power they could buy for less than $4,000 at a standard online retailer.
They found the answer at NewEgg.com, where they were able to purchase -- for just $3,632 -- 9.5 gigaflops of computing speed. That is the amount of computing power offered by a Cray Y-MP supercomputer in 1991 at a cost of $40 million.
