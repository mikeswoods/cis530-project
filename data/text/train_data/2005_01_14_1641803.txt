Concerned that its proposed merger with the Adolph Coors Company might be rejected by its shareholders, Molson increased a special dividend by 67 percent late Thursday.
The dividend, which will be paid to all shareholders except a Molson family holding company, was increased by 2.18 Canadian dollars to 5.44 Canadian dollars a share. The dividend will be paid only if the merger is approved by a two-thirds majority at a shareholders' meeting that has been rescheduled to Jan. 28 from next week.
