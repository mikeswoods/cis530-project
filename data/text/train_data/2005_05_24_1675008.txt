After three years of unemployment, Allen Gruenhut finally landed a job as director of human resources for a company in the stone business on Long Island. His age, 53, worked against him in his long hunt for work, he contends, and so did the six-figure salary he earned at his last job, in banking.
''They would not take me seriously at job interviews when I said I would be happy with a lower salary,'' Mr. Gruenhut said.
