The EMI Group, the British music company, said Monday that sales for the fiscal year ending next month would be as much as 8 percent below those of the prior year. The report sent EMI's stock tumbling 16 percent.
Sales would be lower in part because the release dates for albums by the bands Coldplay and Gorillaz were pushed back, the company said. Both albums were scheduled to come out before the end of March, the end of EMI's fiscal year, but will now be postponed several months. EMI gave no reason for the delay.
