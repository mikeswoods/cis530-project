AFTER being beaten up on all fronts, the airlines are starting to take it out on their computers.
In a move that is expected to save the carriers millions of dollars annually, some airlines have begun to persuade travel agents to shift to Web-based services from the mainframe systems they have used for 30 years. Earlier this month, United Airlines, which is a unit of the UAL Corporation, met with its top travel agents in Chicago to introduce them to three Internet-based reservation systems from ITA Software, G2 SwitchWorks and Farelogix that rely on Web connections and desktop computer technology to search and book seats. These systems cost airlines about $1 for every ticket booked, compared with more than $10 for current booking systems.
