IN 1995, Jeffrey K. Skilling was feeling blue. Since joining Enron from McKinsey & Company five years earlier, he had worked nonstop to build Enron Capital and Trade Resources from the ground up. In that time, the division had become Enron's crown jewel, and the once stodgy pipeline company had been transformed into a sleek and modern trading machine. The division's success had made Mr. Skilling a wealthy man.
But that success had come at a price, he testified at his trial this week. His marriage was in serious trouble. ''And I wanted to spend time with my kids,'' he said. To get some balance back into his life, he decided to share the leadership of the trading unit with Ron Burns, an Enron pipeline executive. Mr. Skilling would work two weeks out of every month, focusing solely on strategy, and leave the operational decisions to Mr. Burns.
