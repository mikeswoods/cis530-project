An extensive study by the Government Accountability Office, delivered to members of Congress yesterday, confirmed that Pentagon rules intended to protect service members from high-pressure or deceptive life insurance sales have been repeatedly violated in recent years.
The study also concluded that the Defense Department failed to effectively address those violations, and it warned that new rules proposed by the Pentagon this summer do not go far enough to repair the department's weaknesses.
