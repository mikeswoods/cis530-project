Jayne Atwell describes herself as a ''G.M. gypsy,'' a name General Motors workers have for people who have been shuffled from plant to plant over the years as the company has closed factories and cut its labor force.
''I've had five plants in the last 10 years and I'm still hanging in there,'' said Ms. Atwell, 42, who now builds dashboards at the G.M. Flint Truck Assembly plant here.
