A NEW YORKER cartoon depicts a well-heeled, elderly gentleman taking his grandson for a walk in the woods. ''It's good to know about trees,'' he tells the boy, before adding, ''Just remember, nobody ever made big money knowing about trees.''
If the man's advice was not inspired directly by the economist's rational-actor model, it could have been. This model assumes that people are selfish in the narrow sense. It may be nice to know about trees, it acknowledges, but it goes on to caution that the world out there is bitterly competitive, and that those who do not pursue their own interests ruthlessly are likely to be swept aside by others who do.
