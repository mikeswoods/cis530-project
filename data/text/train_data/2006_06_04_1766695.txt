LAST Tuesday, when President Bush introduced Henry M. Paulson Jr. as his choice to replace John W. Snow as Treasury secretary, Mr. Bush rattled off a string of impressive economic statistics.
''In the first quarter of 2006, the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 5.3 percent, the fastest growth in two and a half years,'' he said, as Mr. Paulson, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, looked on. ''We added 5.2 million new jobs since August of 2003. The national unemployment rate is down to 4.7 percent. Productivity is high, and that's leading to higher wages and a higher standard of living for the American people.''
