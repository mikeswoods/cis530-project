At Employees Only, a trendy bar and restaurant in the West Village of Manhattan, the good-looking, stylishly attired bartenders do not serve Budweiser. Nor do they sling bottles of Miller, Amstel Light, Heineken or any of the usual well-known beers.
The reason, says a co-owner, Dushan Zaric, is that most beers do not have the rich taste or sophisticated image his customers are looking for. Most drinks ordered at Employees Only come from the wine list and cocktail menu, which feature concoctions like a ginger smash and a Mata Hari with vermouth and Courvoisier.
