Carl C. Icahn said yesterday that he had recruited Frank J. Biondi Jr., the former chief executive of Viacom and Universal Studios, to become Time Warner's chairman and chief executive if Mr. Icahn prevailed in a planned proxy fight for control of the media giant.
Mr. Icahn, the billionaire financier, has been staging a battle to replace the board of Time Warner, where his fund and various others own about 3 percent of the stock. He has told other funds that he believes Time Warner's stock could be worth about $27 a share.
