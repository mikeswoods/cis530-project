GINNY CLARK of Manhattan got a face-lift last April. She had several reasons for seeking out the procedure. Ms. Clark, 62, said she ''wanted to look 20 years younger.'' She was socializing with a rather youthful crowd -- dating a man 10 years younger than she was, and often dining out with friends in their 30's and 40's.
What's more, as a stock trader for the investment firm Cantor Weiss, Ms. Clark was working with a lot of younger people -- a circumstance that gave her pause. Most of her peers, including a brother nine years her junior, were retiring from their Wall Street jobs. But Ms. Clark had no intention of quitting; a younger look, she believed, would extend her career.
