Cellphones here have cash chips that let shoppers swipe them at the register like debit cards. They have crisp color screens for watching television shows and music videos. They have full-fledged Web browsers, and they even have fingerprint readers and cameras with face-recognition software that lock up a phone if a stranger tries to use it.
Interested in getting one? Good luck. You cannot buy one outside Japan.
