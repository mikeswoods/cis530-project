The Canadian nickel mining company Falconbridge became the target of a second takeover bid Wednesday, this time from its largest shareholder, Xstrata of Switzerland. Xstrata, a diversified mining concern that already owns 19.8 percent of Falconbridge, made an all-cash hostile offer valuing the company at 16.1 billion Canadian dollars, or $14.4 billion.
Xstrata's bid, at 52.50 Canadian dollars a share, exceeded a friendly cash and equity offer from Canada's leading nickel mining concern, Inco, which increased its proposal to 51.17 Canadian dollars on Sunday night. Both offers, however, are below Falconbridge's current market price of 55.60 Canadian dollars after Wednesday's market close in Toronto.
