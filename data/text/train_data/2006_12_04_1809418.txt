A few years ago, few people would have imagined spending hours in front of the television watching professional poker. Now competitive video gaming is going to get a shot at mainstream network treatment when an hourlong special about the World Series of Video Games appears as part of the CBS Sports Spectacular on Dec. 30.
The event will mark the first time that professional video gaming will be broadcast as a sport on network television. ''They Got Game: The Stars of the World Series of Video Games Presented by Intel,'' is the pinnacle of 20 hours of television programming about the event that is being shown across several Viacom outlets, including MTV and College Sports Television.
