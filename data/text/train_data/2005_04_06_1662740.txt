Unlike the United States, the European Union is not yet considering action to stem the surge in textile imports from China that followed the end of quotas last year, a European trade official said on Tuesday.
Instead, the European Commission, which takes the lead on international trade issues for all 25 countries in the union, will complete a set of guidelines on Wednesday to determine when and how to step in. The guidelines would set parameters, possibly on market share or unit volume, that could ultimately set off safeguards.
