Univision Communications, the largest owner of television networks aimed at Hispanic viewers, announced ambitious plans yesterday to expand programming into genres long popular with its English-language counterparts and competitors.
At a high-energy presentation at Lincoln Center, part of what the advertising industry calls upfront week, executives of the flagship Univision network of Univision Communications said they would introduce a late-night talk show, to be called ''¡Ay, Qué Noche!,'' or ''Oh, What a Night!,'' and a Sunday morning discussion program from Washington, to be called ''Punto de Encuentro con Jorge Ramos,'' or ''Meeting Point with Jorge Ramos.'' Mr. Ramos is a longtime Univision news anchor.
