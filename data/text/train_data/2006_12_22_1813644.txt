Bristol-Myers Squibb has reached a tentative agreement to pay $499 million to settle a federal investigation into illegal sales and marketing activities from the late 1990s through 2005, the company said yesterday.
That settlement, and separate special charges the company also announced yesterday, would wipe out Bristol-Myers fourth-quarter profit. But its shares rose on the indication that the company was resolving a big legal issue and tidying up its books, making it a more viable takeover candidate. The United States attorney's office in Boston, which first subpoenaed the records of Bristol-Myers in the matter in 2003, declined to confirm the announcement, saying it did not comment on such negotiations unless a final settlement has been signed.
