President Bush on Friday nominated Frederic S. Mishkin, a professor of monetary policy at Columbia, to fill an open seat on the Federal Reserve Board.
Professor Mishkin, 55, has been a prolific author of books and articles about central banking and would add weight within the Fed to backers of ''inflation targeting,'' a policy of basing decisions on explicit and publicly disclosed benchmarks for inflation.
