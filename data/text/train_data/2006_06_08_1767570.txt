Three former top officers of Buca Inc., an operator of Italian restaurants, have agreed to plead guilty to federal fraud charges in connection with a scheme to create false profits for Buca and allow executives to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay for a wide range of expenses including the use of an Italian villa and visits to strip clubs.
Lawyers for the company's former chairman and chief executive, Joseph P. Micatrotto; its former chief financial officer, Greg A. Gadel; and a former controller, John J. Motschenbacher, said yesterday that their clients would plead guilty to the charges.
