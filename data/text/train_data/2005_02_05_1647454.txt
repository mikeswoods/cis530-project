Honda Motor urged the federal government on Friday to impose tougher fuel- economy regulations, an unheard- of request from an automaker.
The request was meant as a gesture to environmental groups after the Thursday decision by Honda and Nissan to join an industry lawsuit against California, which is seeking to regulate the emissions from cars and trucks of gases that are said to worsen global warming. Most other automakers have already sued the state to block what would be the first such effort in the nation.
