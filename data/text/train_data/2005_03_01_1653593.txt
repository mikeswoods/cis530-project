Financial regulators on Monday announced the creation of an international board to oversee the setting of auditing standards. But the board will not have the power to inspect whether auditing standards are being effectively administered, leaving that to national regulatory bodies that in some cases are only beginning to be formed.
The creation of the group, the Public Interest Oversight Board, came in the wake of accounting scandals in many countries, scandals that in some cases exposed what appeared to be poor auditing procedures or worse.
