The pharmaceutical company Pfizer received bids worth more than $14 billion for its consumer products unit, which includes household names like Listerine and Sudafed, people involved in the auction said yesterday.
The offers, these people said, came from some of the company's big rivals like GlaxoSmithKline and Johnson & Johnson, as well as a British household cleaning products maker, Reckitt Benckiser.
