FROM the jolly back-and-forth between Continental Airlines executives and Boeing executives at the Newark airport last week, it was evident to me that a good-size sum of money was about to change hands somewhere.
Officially, Boeing was present in the huge Continental hangar to give the New York news media a look at its newest long-haul plane, the 777-200LR, which will enter commercial service next year. One of the planes, on a 20-city world demonstration tour, was on display.
