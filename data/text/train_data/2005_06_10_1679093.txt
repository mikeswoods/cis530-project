Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned Thursday that the American economy faces significant ''imbalances'' and made it clear that he was not yet finished with ratcheting up interest rates.
In testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Mr. Greenspan said the economy was on a ''reasonably firm footing'' but expressed concern about the ''negligible'' rate of personal savings, the huge trade deficit and growing evidence of risky speculation in the housing market.
