GoDaddy.com, the Web site registrar that gained national attention with a controversial commercial during the Super Bowl last month, said yesterday that it would not extend its contract with the agency that created the commercial, the Ad Store in New York, after the contract expires on Thursday.
While the work for GoDaddy.com was outstanding, said Bob Parsons, president of the GoDaddy Group in Scottsdale, Ariz., ''We're moving forward with a much simpler ad that's done for a more targeted audience.'' He confirmed a report about the decision not to renew the contract that appeared this week in Adweek.
