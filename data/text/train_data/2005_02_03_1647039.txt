The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates on Wednesday, its sixth increase since June, and signaled that it intends to keep raising rates in the months to come.
The central bank nudged the federal funds rate, the rate charged on overnight loans between banks, by a quarter of a point, to 2.5 percent.
