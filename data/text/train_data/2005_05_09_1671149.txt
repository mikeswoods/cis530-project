Vonage, the Internet telephone company, is expected to announce formally today that it has raised $200 million in new private investments, one of the largest single rounds of venture capital financing in the last decade.
The size of the deal underscores the confidence of the lead investors, including several major Silicon Valley venture capital firms, that Vonage, a privately held company, can continue to thrive as an Internet telephone provider even as regional Bell companies and cable providers enter the business.
