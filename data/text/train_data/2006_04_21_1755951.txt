Alltel, the mobile phone company, announced a new service plan yesterday that lets customers make free calls to any 10 numbers regardless of the cellphone or land-line carrier of the person being called.
The ''My Circle'' plan, a first among major carriers, is premised on statistics that show that many consumers make most of their calls to about half a dozen numbers. Alltel expects that if customers can call these popular numbers free, they will have more minutes left over to call other people.
