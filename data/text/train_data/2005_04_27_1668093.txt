Two participants in a discontinued clinical drug trial have sued Amgen, demanding that it resume giving them an experimental treatment for Parkinson's disease that they say helped them immensely but that the company says is ineffective and potentially dangerous.
In their lawsuit, filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the plaintiffs say Amgen ''treated the patients as mere guinea pigs, as material to be discarded,'' and had violated a legal and moral obligation to continue to supply the drug.
