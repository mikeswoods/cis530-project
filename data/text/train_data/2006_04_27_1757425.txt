The accounting firm KPMG has enticed enough investors back into a revised settlement over tax shelters, and will now pay out around $150 million to 209 eligible investors.
An earlier $195 million deal, brokered last September through the securities class-action law firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman, collapsed after 64 of the 284 investors chose not to take part, saying the agreement did not offer them enough compensation.
