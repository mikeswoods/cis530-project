VIACOM announced yesterday that the new CBS Corporation would acquire CSTV Networks, a cable channel and confederation of Web sites that focus entirely on college sports. The purchase will be made with $325 million in stock to be issued next year by CBS, which will be created after its split from Viacom.
CSTV started in April 2003 largely as the cable channel College Sports TV, carrying some major sports, like basketball and football, but primarily showing sports that were seen far less frequently, like rugby, squash, wrestling, volleyball and water polo.
