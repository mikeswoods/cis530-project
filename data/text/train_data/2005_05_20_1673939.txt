Looked across the room at Babbo recently and figured that the man and woman splitting an expensive bottle of wine worked on Wall Street? Good assumption. Did you further guess that they were investment bankers? You may need to expand your portfolio of stereotypes.
They just may have been the new face of Wall Street, the newly empowered -- and often newly rich -- compliance lawyer. They are often the only people standing between their investment firms and a lethal blow from the government, and their status is assured and growing.
