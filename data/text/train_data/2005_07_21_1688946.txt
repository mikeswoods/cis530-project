A month ago, Sanford I. Weill basked in the limelight as more than 300 Wall Street power brokers, elite dignitaries and political insiders filled tents outside his Greenwich, Conn., mansion, joining him and his wife, Joan, to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary.
According to one attendee, Mr. Weill was all smiles as he mingled with dignitaries like former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, as well as top Citigroup managers, including the chief executive, Charles O. Prince, late into the evening. The shining moment of the event? When Pope Benedict XVI sent along his blessings to the couple.
