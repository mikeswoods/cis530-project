PRESIDENT BUSH'S proposal to privatize some aspects of Social Security has focused attention on the unrealistic expectations that many individual investors -- and politicians, for that matter -- have for the stock market over the long term. But several researchers warn that many companies also have inflated expectations for the stocks underpinning their pension plans. To the extent that those companies have to make up for the plans' deficits, a significant miscalculation about stock returns could greatly reduce their earnings per share -- further depressing stock prices.
Robert D. Arnott, the chairman of Research Affiliates, a research and asset management firm based in Pasadena, Calif., says the typical corporation is now projecting that the investments in its pension plan will grow at an annualized rate of around 8.5 percent. Because the average pension plan has about two-thirds of its investments in stocks and a third in bonds, this implies a long-term stock return of more than 10 percent a year. Given current expectations about inflation, that works out to a real, or inflation-adjusted, return of around 7 percent.
