The federal government said yesterday that it had reached an agreement to take over all four of United Airlines' employee pension plans, with a shortfall of $9.8 billion, making it the biggest pension failure since the government began insuring pension benefits in 1974.
The agreement, if approved by a federal bankruptcy judge, would remove an obstacle to the UAL Corporation's emergence from bankruptcy protection, which it entered in December 2002; UAL owns United.
