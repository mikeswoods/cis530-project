Jeffrey K. Skilling denied on Tuesday that he ever arranged secret side deals known as ''bear hugs'' to enrich Andrew S. Fastow when Mr. Fastow was chief financial officer of Enron.
''I don't even know what a bear hug is,'' said Mr. Skilling, Enron's former chief executive, who was testifying in his own defense for a second day. ''I had no agreement with Andy Fastow that would give him a guaranteed rate of return. Period. Full-stop.''
