Shares of the Guidant Corporation, a heart device maker, slid yesterday as investors took the news that the company had received two Justice Department subpoenas as a further sign that Johnson & Johnson would reduce or abandon its $25.4 billion offer to buy Guidant.
Late Monday, Guidant and two other makers of pacemakers and defibrillators, Medtronic and St. Jude Medical, disclosed that they had received subpoenas from the United States attorney in Boston as part of a federal investigation into whether the companies used illegal inducements to get doctors to use their products.
