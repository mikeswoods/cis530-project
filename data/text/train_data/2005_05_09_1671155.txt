''Harvey Birdman'' is the sort of name you might hear David Letterman repeating as a non sequitur several times during ''The Late Show'' on CBS.
In fact, Mr. Birdman is of increasing relevance to Mr. Letterman and his NBC counterpart, Jay Leno. He is the protagonist of ''Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law,'' a campy animated program about a superhero-turned-not-very-bright-lawyer. That show, which airs on the Cartoon Network during Mr. Letterman's time slot, and a suite of other irreverent, animated shows, make up a seven-hour programming block called ''Adult Swim.''
