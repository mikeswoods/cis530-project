CBS News announced yesterday that Bob Schieffer, the host of ''Face the Nation'' for more than a decade, will become the interim anchor of ''The CBS Evening News'' after Dan Rather quits the broadcast on March 9.
While ensuring that the ''Evening News'' will be led by a veteran journalist recognizable to many of Mr. Rather's viewers, the decision by the network to appoint an interim anchor lays bare not only the internal disarray surrounding Mr. Rather's departure but also the news division's failure in recent years to devise an orderly succession plan for his broadcast.
