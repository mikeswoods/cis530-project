The weekly New Yorker received 10 nominations in 9 categories in the 40th annual award lineup. The categories include best magazine for general excellence among magazines with a circulation of one million to two million, and best of the public interest category for three articles by Seymour M. Hersh last May, including one on the Abu Ghraib prison scandal.
