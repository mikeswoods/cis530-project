Doug Herzog, the president of Comedy Central, has been chosen to take over Spike TV, the fledgling ''network for men,'' whose previous president resigned last weekend. Mr. Herzog will take over Spike while maintaining his position at Comedy Central; Viacom owns both channels.
Herb Scannell, the president of the MTV Networks Group, which oversees Spike TV, said he hoped Mr. Herzog would create a signature show for a channel that now features ample portions of testosterone-heavy fare like pro wrestling and sports biographies, as well as ''Star Trek'' reruns.
