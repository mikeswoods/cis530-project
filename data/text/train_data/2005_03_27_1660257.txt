LAZINESS is a curse. It is as bad as a disability. In fact, it is a disability. I tell this to my son constantly, but I have to also say it to myself.
Like too many other people, I am often lazy when it comes to my investing -- even though I think about investing a great deal and have great hopes for someday living off my capital and swimming lazily back and forth in my pool in Rancho Mirage. But laziness works against me, as it does against all lazy investors.
