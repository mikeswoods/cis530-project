WHEN you call Chez Escargot to plead for a reservation, do they laugh and say they have no table for you? Are you down in the dumps because an old college pal said his people would get in touch with your people, and you had to admit you didn't have any people?
Does it sometimes feel as if the whole world is a V.I.P. list and your name is not on it?
