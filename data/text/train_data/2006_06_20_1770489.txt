A Federal Reserve governor, Mark W. Olson, was named yesterday as the chairman of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which regulates accounting firms and has come under fire from companies complaining that the costs of regulation have grown too high.
Mr. Olson's appointment, which gives him the job until 2010, came nearly nine months after his predecessor, William J. McDonough, said he was stepping down, leaving the board with an acting chairman as the political pressure grew.
