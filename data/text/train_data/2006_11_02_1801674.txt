Ginger Stickel, like most Americans, has been getting a lot more junk mail these days. Yesterday, for example, she received 37 pieces of mail, and 28 were junk, including a pitch for mail-order pizzas and a flier for a warehouse furniture sale. Surprisingly, she says she doesn't mind.
''I would rather get a catalogue over a call during dinner 10 times over,'' Ms. Stickel, a mother of two young children in Greenwich, Conn., said. ''I always open those letters, and sometimes they're useful.''
