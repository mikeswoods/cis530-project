THE cause of crustacean rights took a small leap forward on June 16, when Whole Foods Market said that its more than 180 stores would no longer sell live lobsters and crabs. It cited a commitment to ''humane treatment and quality of life'' for all animals.
Advocates of animal rights quickly hailed the decision, saying it would also spare the crustaceans from the vicious fate of being boiled alive, with no anesthetic to dull the agony, once shoppers brought them home.
