EBay said yesterday that it had selected BBDO Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, to replace another Omnicom agency, Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, which had worked for eBay since 1999. EBay unexpectedly dismissed Goodby, Silverstein late Tuesday.
EBay spent an estimated $80 million last year on advertising in major media, according to TNS Media Intelligence.
