Michael Kinsley, the provocative editorial and opinion-page editor of The Los Angeles Times, said yesterday that he would be changing jobs in the next few months and most likely would no longer be running the department. He will not necessarily leave the editorial page, he said, but his new role is still being worked out.
''It's a very complicated arrangement I have, and not all aspects are working as well as others,'' Mr. Kinsley, 54, said in a telephone interview yesterday from Seattle, from which he commutes to Los Angeles every other week.
