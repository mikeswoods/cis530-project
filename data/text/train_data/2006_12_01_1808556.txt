Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican and departing chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has asked NASD, the securities industry's largest self-regulatory organization, to describe in detail how it identifies and tracks possible insider trading among its members.
Mr. Grassley's staff is investigating the Securities and Exchange Commission's handling of an insider-trading case involving a prominent hedge fund. The questions being asked of NASD indicate that Congressional scrutiny of the nation's market regulators is growing.
