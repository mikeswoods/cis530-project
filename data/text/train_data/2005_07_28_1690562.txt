Some weeks, Jos√© Edgardo Andrande makes less than $200. Other weeks, his pay tops $1,200. ''But then it goes down to $500'' the next week, said Mr. Andrande, 42, a job hopper from El Salvador who, for 24 years, has shuffled among delivery, electrician, restaurant and construction jobs in the United States.
Despite the fluctuations, one financial transaction has remained constant. Each month he sends $700 home to support his two sons and mother in his native San Salvador.
