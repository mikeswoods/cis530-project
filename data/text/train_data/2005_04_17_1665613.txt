LIKE many doctors in private practice, Andrew A. Slemp Jr. figured that he could earn enough from the small surgical group he started in Roanoke, Va., to enjoy a comfortable retirement. But Dr. Slemp, who is in his early 60's, recently dissolved his practice after running into financial trouble when his malpractice insurer collapsed.
In Kansas City, Kan., another doctor, Joel N. Schroeder, is considering filing for bankruptcy. He is unable to pay a $750,000 malpractice claim that a state judge levied against him on behalf of survivors of an elderly stroke victim. Before the case went to trial, Dr. Schroeder, who contested the accusation, learned that his malpractice insurer, the same as Dr. Slemp's, had imploded.
