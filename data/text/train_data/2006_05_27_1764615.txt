Arcelor said on Friday that it had agreed to acquire a Russian steel company in a deal that would repel a hostile takeover by the Mittal Steel Company and create the biggest steel maker in the world.
If successful, the deal would bump Mittal out of the industry's top spot, creating a behemoth with sales of 46 billion euros ($59 billion) and annual production of 70 million tons.
