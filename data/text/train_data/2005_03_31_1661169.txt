Several large orthopedics manufacturers said yesterday that they had received subpoenas from the Justice Department, seeking information about the industry's relationships with surgeons who implant artificial knees and hips.
Stryker, a manufacturer based in Kalamazoo, Mich., said that it had received a request on Monday for documents that covered any agreement since January 2002 that called for it to pay knee and hip surgeons for consulting, services or other work. The request also covered arrangements with medical students in orthopedic training who were using or considering using Stryker's products to replace or reconstruct hips and knees.
