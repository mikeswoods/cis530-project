Earlier this year, the feminist writer Susan Estrich said that women's bylines appeared far less frequently than men's on newspaper opinion pages like those of The Los Angeles Times. Now, a Condé Nast editor is making a similar case against several of publishing's top general-interest magazines -- including some owned by Condé Nast.
Ruth Davis Konigsberg, a deputy editor at Glamour, began counting bylines in Harper's, The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, Vanity Fair and The Atlantic Monthly. Since the beginning of September, she has tallied 324 male bylines and 99 female ones. She has displayed the results on a Web site, www.womenTK.com.
