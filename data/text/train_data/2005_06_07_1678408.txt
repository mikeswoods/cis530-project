A former senior executive of the General Re Corporation, John Houldsworth, plans to plead guilty this week to federal criminal charges of helping the insurer American International Group doctor its books, according to Mr. Houldsworth's lawyer and prosecutors conducting a wide-ranging investigation of abuses in the insurance industry.
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department also said yesterday that Mr. Houldsworth, who was fired yesterday by General Re, would cooperate with law enforcement authorities as they investigate and seek to prosecute other executives involved in fraudulent transactions. His guilty plea would be the first from a major figure in the inquiry.
