''The Passion of the Christ'' made $611.4 million worldwide at the box office, but its director, Mel Gibson, still wants to spread the word.
Mr. Gibson has edited several scenes for a new, less graphic version of his film about the life and death of Jesus Christ. Called ''The Passion Recut,'' it will be released March 11 in 750 theaters across the country and, in a twist for a widely distributed movie, it will carry no rating from the Motion Picture Association of America.
