On a Friday morning not long ago, a surgical team at the New York Hospital for Joint Diseases sliced, drilled, probed, sawed and hammered its way through a two-hour operation to replace the left knee of Joseph Madden, a retired policeman, with a metal and plastic substitute.
Hovering in the background, when he was not scurrying off to two neighboring operating rooms to peek in on knee operations there, was Dan Driesse, a sales representative for the Stryker Corporation. Stryker, based in Kalamazoo, Mich., manufactured all three artificial knees being implanted that morning.
