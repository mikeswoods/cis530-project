DO you remember when Oliver Stone's paranoid fantasy about the Kennedy assassination, ''J.F.K.,'' was released in 1991?
What remains most vivid to me was the absolute fury the movie provoked among political reporters and columnists, who deplored Mr. Stone's view of the Kennedy assassination as a conspiracy, and his depiction of the delusional New Orleans district attorney, Jim Garrison, as a hero. The op-ed fulminations contained an almost palpable frustration: millions of Americans were going to buy into Mr. Stone's rewriting of history -- and there wasn't a thing the punditocracy could do about it.
