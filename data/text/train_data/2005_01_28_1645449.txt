Riggs Bank in Washington pleaded guilty yesterday to repeatedly failing to report suspicious transactions in bank accounts held by the leaders of oil-rich Equatorial Guinea and by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former dictator of Chile.
Riggs agreed to pay a $16 million penalty as part of a deal that would avoid prosecution of the bank and its holding company, Riggs National Corporation, on charges related to money laundering that has linked the financial and political worlds. The bank also agreed to continue to cooperate with a Justice Department investigation, including inquiries into the activities of several former executives and managers.
