The Ford Motor Company said Tuesday that it would cut 5 percent, or about 1,700, of its white-collar jobs in North America. It also said it would no longer give bonuses to managers or make matching contributions to the 401(k) plans of salaried employees.
Ford also lowered its yearly earnings forecast to $1 to $1.25 a share, compared with a previous forecast of $1.25 to $1.50 a share, saying it expected sluggish vehicle sales to continue. It was the second time in two and a half months that Ford cut its earnings projections for the year.
