Nearly the size of an old station wagon, a bright orange machine here mashes plastic pellets into rows of six-inch-long blue clips for hospitals across the United States. Pan Guotao, a 29-year-old worker from a village in northern China, sits on a plastic stool next to the machine and wields a straight razor to slice apart the clips, which are used to hold ice packs in plastic sleeves.
It looks like a simple operation, but it lies at the heart of the American trade deficit with China.
