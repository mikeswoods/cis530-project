Scott D. Sullivan, the former chief financial officer of WorldCom, who faces 25 years in jail for his role in an accounting fraud that toppled the company, agreed yesterday to forfeit his lavish Florida estate and his retirement fund to settle a class-action lawsuit.
To settle a case brought by the New York State Common Retirement Fund, Mr. Sullivan will hand over his 30,000-square-foot mansion in Boca Raton, Fla., which is now being offered for sale at $10.9 million.
