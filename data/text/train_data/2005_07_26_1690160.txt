The Walt Disney Company on Monday chose Daniel Battsek, who has overseen the company's film distribution in Britain, to run Miramax Films after the departure of its co-chairmen, Harvey and Bob Weinstein.
When Mr. Battsek, 47, takes over after the Weinsteins step down on Sept. 30, he faces the challenge of re-establishing the Miramax label as a force for independent or specialty films, even as Disney is expected to slash its budget by half or more. That in turn, could reduce the unit's slate from as many as 20 or 25 films a year, to as few as 6 to 10.
