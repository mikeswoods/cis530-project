ONCE upon a time, in a bygone era, a new creature began stalking Wall Street. He was called a ''corporate raider,'' and he made strange utterances that executives had not heard before.
He growled that executives cared more about building empires than building shareholder value. He bought big stakes in bloated, inefficient companies and began demanding -- demanding! -- that chief executives cut loose money-losing units to become more competitive. He insisted that management be paid with stock and options so that they would start caring about the stock price, and would be rewarded as their shareholders were rewarded.
