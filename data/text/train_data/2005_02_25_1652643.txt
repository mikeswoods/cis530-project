The board of May Department Stores plans to meet Saturday, an indication that it expects to receive a bid from its rival, Federated Department Stores, an executive close to the negotiations said last night.
The meeting of May's board, which had been unscheduled, would come after a meeting today by Federated's board. Federated directors are expected to weigh whether to offer about $12 billion for May, other executives close to the talks said.
