The attorneys general in New York, Connecticut and Illinois are in negotiations with Aon, the world's second-largest insurance broker, to settle investigations into whether the company received improper payments from insurance companies that increased costs for its customers, some of the officials said yesterday.
''We're in talks,'' said Darren Dopp, a spokesman for Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general.
