Members of Congress opposed to a Chinese bid to take over the California-based energy company Unocal built broader support yesterday for their campaign to block the deal on the ground that it could threaten national and energy security in the United States.
But China is not the first foreign country to seek American energy assets. Indeed, oil industry analysts say that the effort by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation to outbid Chevron for Unocal appears to pose less risk of generating domestic shortages or other energy-security headaches than other foreign acquisitions that have been approved by the government.
