Members of the United Automobile Workers have given their union permission to call a strike against the Delphi Corporation if a bankruptcy judge allows the company to void its labor contracts and reduce their pay.
More than 95 percent of the union members who cast ballots voted to approve a strike, the U.A.W. said on Tuesday.
