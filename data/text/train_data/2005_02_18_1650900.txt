Saudi Aramco, the world's largest producer of crude oil, is seeking to strengthen relations with energy companies in India and China as part of a strategy to increase Saudi oil exports there. Together, the two countries are expected to account for much of the increase in global oil demand over the next decade.
At the same time, Abdallah S. Jumah, the president and chief executive at Aramco, the energy company controlled by the Saudi kingdom, said on Wednesday that the company was hoping to maintain its position as a leading supplier of petroleum to the United States, the largest consumer of Saudi oil.
