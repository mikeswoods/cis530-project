Ben F. Glisan Jr., the government's last big witness in the Enron trial, testified on Tuesday that Enron was ''weak'' when Jeffrey K. Skilling resigned as chief executive in August of 2001, even as Mr. Skilling was claiming it was in ''great shape.''
Mr. Glisan, a former Enron treasurer who reported to the former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, took the stand late on Tuesday in his much-anticipated testimony in the trial of Mr. Skilling and Enron's founder, Kenneth L. Lay, who are accused of conspiring to defraud Enron investors.
