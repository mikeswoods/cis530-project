Deutsche Lufthansa said Tuesday that it had won approval for a staggered takeover of Swiss International Airlines, the successor to the defunct Swissair, setting a floating price for the embattled carrier.
Lufthansa's chief executive, Wolfgang Mayrhuber, and the head of Swiss International Airlines, Christoph Franz, signed an agreement in Zurich to push ahead with the takeover. The deal could be worth as much as 310 million euros ($405 million), and the 15 percent of free-floating stock could be valued up to 45 million euros ($58.8 million).
