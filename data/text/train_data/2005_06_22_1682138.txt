Federal banking regulators said yesterday that they had started an investigation into CardSystems Solutions, the payment processor where a security breach has put millions of American cardholders at risk for fraud.
The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, an interagency group of the federal banking regulators, said the investigation began last week. Officials are assessing security at CardSystems' operational centers, at the major credit card companies and at any banks that may be involved, the council said. It would not identify the banks contacted in the inquiry.
