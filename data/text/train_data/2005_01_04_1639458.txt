Archipelago Holdings, the owner of ArcaEx, the largest electronic stock market, confirmed late last night that it would buy the Pacific Exchange for about $50 million.
While the deal would be relatively small, it is a sign of Archipelago's ambitions, giving the company its first options trading business. The acquisition comes as electronic markets and the traditional floor-based exchanges are scrambling to diversify. It also comes on the eve of anticipated new rules from the Securities and Exchange Commission that could alter the business of every exchange and marketplace.
