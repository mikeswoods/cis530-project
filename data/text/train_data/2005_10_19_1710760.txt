Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck had a setback yesterday in their plans to market a first-of-its-kind diabetes medication that aims to control blood sugar while also lowering cholesterol.
The Food and Drug Administration deferred approval of the drug, Pargluva, and asked for more information about its cardiovascular safety. The companies said the agency wanted additional information from patient trials completed since Bristol-Myers and Merck submitted data in support of their application.
