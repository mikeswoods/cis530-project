The Japanese Internet start-up Livedoor and the Fuji Television Network are discussing a possible alliance, signaling that a contentious two-month struggle for control of a Tokyo radio broadcaster may end amicably.
The two companies have been locked in a battle for the radio company, the Nippon Broadcasting System, which is an affiliate of Fuji TV, Japan's biggest private television network. Livedoor, an Internet services and portal company, stunned Japan's investment community by buying up more than half the shares in the radio broadcaster in the last two months, dislodging Fuji TV as Nippon Broadcasting's largest shareholder.
