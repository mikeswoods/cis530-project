The Maytag Corporation said last night that a consortium led by Qingdao Haier, a Chinese appliance maker, had offered to acquire all its outstanding stock for $16 a share.
Interest by the consortium, which also includes the Blackstone Group and Bain Capital, could ignite a takeover battle for Maytag, which agreed on May 19 to be acquired by another group, led by Ripplewood Holdings, for $1.13 billion, or $14 a share.
