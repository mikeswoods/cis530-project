MCI's board is likely to seek a sweetened takeover offer from Verizon Communications, an executive close to the company said yesterday.
On Saturday, Verizon agreed to buy out the company's biggest shareholder, Carlos Slim Hel√∫, for $25.72 a share, 11 percent more than it said it would pay per share for the rest of the company. After buying Mr. Slim's stake, Verizon would become MCI's largest shareholder.
