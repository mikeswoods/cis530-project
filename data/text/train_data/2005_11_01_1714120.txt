A Merck lawyer questioned the plaintiff's credibility in a closing argument Monday at the Vioxx personal injury trial here, saying that the drug had not caused the man's heart attack.
The lawyer, Diane Sullivan, told the panel of nine jurors, six women and three men, that the plaintiff, Frederick Humeston, 60, a postal worker from Idaho, had many risk factors that could have led him to suffer a heart attack in September 2001, which he survived. Those factors included Mr. Humeston's weight and his repeated clashes with his post office supervisors, Ms. Sullivan said.
