The European Commission issued one of its largest fines against a cartel on Wednesday when it found five acrylic glass makers guilty of colluding and fixing prices.
Arkema of France, formerly known as Atofina; Imperial Chemical Industries and the Lucite International Group of Britain; and Quinn Barlo of Ireland were fined a total of 344.5 million euros ($443 million). Degussa of Germany also participated in the cartel but was not fined because it blew the whistle on the cartel, which ran for five years, and it cooperated in the regulators' investigation, the commission said.
