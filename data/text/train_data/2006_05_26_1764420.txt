Standard & Poor's Ratings Services said on Thursday that it might cut Ford's debt rating deeper into junk status, citing concerns that the company's turnaround was falling short of expectations.
S.& P. put Ford and its finance unit on CreditWatch with negative implications, citing the ''deteriorating product mix and market share in North America and persistently high commodity costs generally.''
