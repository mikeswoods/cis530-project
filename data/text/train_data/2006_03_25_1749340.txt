In a rare move, the Securities and Exchange Commission late yesterday set aside a lifetime ban from the securities industry imposed on the former investment banker Frank P. Quattrone, just days after a federal appeals court overturned his 2004 conviction on obstruction of justice charges.
The S.E.C. said yesterday that NASD, the market regulator that imposed the ban, violated its own rules in taking the action in November 2004.
