India's largest airline, Jet Airways, said on Thursday that it would buy the rival Air Sahara  for $500 million in cash in the first signs of consolidation in an increasingly competitive airline market.
Jet Airways said the deal would increase its share of the domestic market to about 50 percent. The deal was approved on Thursday by the Jet Airways board and now awaits regulatory approvals.
