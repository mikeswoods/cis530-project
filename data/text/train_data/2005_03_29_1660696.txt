DIVERGING FORTUNES -- Major airlines lost nearly one-third of their full-time work force in the last four years, while jobs at low-cost carriers rebounded, according to data released yesterday by the Transportation Department. The number of people employed full time by network carriers fell 31 percent in January, to 273,305, from the month in 2001, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics at the department said. During the same period, the number of full-time workers at budget carriers rose 15 percent, to 68,089.
HIRING A PRIVATE JET -- CitationShares, a fractional-share jet provider, said yesterday that its Vector JetCard service now offers flight time in increments of 20 hours, five hours less than the industry's standard minimum. With jet cards, customers buy flight time on corporate jets but avoid the complications of full or fractional ownership. The new program ''reduces the barriers to entry'' for those who want to fly corporate jets, ''with less commitment in terms of both flight time and expense,'' said CitationShares, which is jointly owned by the Cessna Aircraft Company unit of Textron and TAG Aviation. The cheapest 20-hour Vector JetCard is $75,995 for 20 hours' time on a five-passenger, 1,400-mile-range Citation CJ1. The most expensive is $119,995 for 20 hours on an eight-passenger, 2,100-mile-range Citation Excel, a spokeswoman said. A competitor, the industry-leading jet-card provider, Marquis Jet, offers 25-hour cards that start at $109,900 for the seven-passenger, 2,000-mile-range Citation Ultra and go to $339,900 for the 14-passenger Gulfstream V, which has a range of about 6,000 miles. At the top of the scale, meanwhile, Marquis Jet announced last week a new service, M Club, that will allow up to 100 new members to pay $125,000 toward flight time in the top-end Boeing Business Jet, which has 1,000 square feet of cabin space, including two bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms. That jet costs $15,696 an hour, plus tax, a Marquis spokesman said.
