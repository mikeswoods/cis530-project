THE old story of technology in business was a trickle-down affair. From telephones to computers, big companies came first.

Now that pattern is being challenged by a bottom-up revolution, one fueled by a second wave of Internet technologies like the search services from Google, Yahoo and Microsoft and software delivered as a utilitylike service over the Web.
