When Lenovo, the upstart laptop maker, bought I.B.M.'s ThinkPad division last year, it promised to overhaul Big Blue's staid and expensive line of business computers. Its ThinkPad C100 is a first attempt to deliver on that promise.
The C100, available now in retail stores and at www.lenovo.com, is a low-cost laptop with a built-in optical drive and a 15.4-inch screen. Designed as the workhorse of the new 3000 series, this laptop starts at $599 for a model with an Intel Celeron M processor.
