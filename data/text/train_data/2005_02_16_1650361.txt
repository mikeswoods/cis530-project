A senior executive at Marsh & McLennan Companies and two employees of the American International Group pleaded guilty yesterday to criminal charges of rigging bids for corporate insurance policies.
Six other executives, including one from Marsh and two from A.I.G., had earlier pleaded guilty amid an investigation of the insurance industry by the New York attorney general. All nine are cooperating with investigators, who say they already have leads implicating several dozen executives at Marsh, the world's largest insurance broker, and several major insurance companies.
