Shortly before he moved to Greece last year, an American named John Econopouly received the unpleasant news that he needed a hernia operation. He had the surgery done in Northern California, and it didn't go so well.
After spending less than a day in the hospital as an outpatient, Mr. Econopouly went to a friend's house to sleep off the surgery and found that his wound had reopened. ''I woke up in a pool of blood and didn't know what to do,'' he remembered. ''Basically, I didn't feel cared for.''
