United Airlines is expected to end its 38-month stay in bankruptcy proceedings on Wednesday, but the carrier may not be profitable this year because of a recent surge in fuel prices.
Many of United's 57,000 workers, meanwhile, though relieved to be ending their stay in bankruptcy, are wary of management's plans to continue to streamline the carrier. Still somewhat untested, union representatives say, are work rule changes negotiated as part of the bankruptcy and just how much more employees can be asked to do.
