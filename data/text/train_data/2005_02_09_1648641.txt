For the last year, the chief executive of the Neiman Marcus Group, Burton M. Tansky, known as Mr. Luxury, has been crowing about the consistent double-digit sales growth in his stores and the steady ascent of the company's stock.
Now, Neiman Marcus, with 37 stores and a reputation for fabulous shoes and expensive designer clothing, may be looking to cash in on that performance. Richard A. Smith, 81, the chairman, has let it be known that he is thinking of selling his stock in the company, say several investment bankers. Through his company General Cinema, Mr. Smith took a big stake in Neiman's parent in 1984, buying convertible shares for $300 million, and the Smith family now controls the company.
