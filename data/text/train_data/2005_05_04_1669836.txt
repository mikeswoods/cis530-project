The Washington bureau chiefs at seven major news organizations are pressing the White House to curtail the use of background briefings, which administration officials regularly hold on the condition that the officials not be identified in news reports.
In an e-mail message sent on Monday, the bureau chiefs urged other Washington editors to object to such briefings as soon as the administration, executive agencies or legislators schedule them.
