The British holding company Virgin Group said Thursday that it had raised the $177.3 million needed to start a low-fare airline in the United States, disquieting news to domestic carriers hoping for an industrywide reduction in fleet to help push up fares.
The new airline, Virgin America, would operate 17 narrow-body Airbus A320 planes on longer-distance domestic routes between major cities. A spokeswoman, Stacy Geagan, said the airline planned service from several cities, including New York and San Francisco. ''We can be ready in mid-2006,'' she added.
