WEDNESDAY'S announcement came as little surprise to tobacco companies and their opponents: cigarette sales had fallen once again, hitting a 55-year low.
Tobacco companies have been on the defensive since reaching a landmark $246 billion settlement with the states in 1998, and cigarette sales in the United States have declined more than 20 percent since then. In addition, many states and city governments have passed laws banning smoking in workplaces, restaurants and bars.
