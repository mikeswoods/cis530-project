Digeo, a company that designs software for set-top boxes used with cable television systems, will announce today that it has selected Samsung, the Korean electronics giant, to make its next generation of boxes.
The deal is an effort by the two companies to break into a market that has been tightly controlled by Scientific Atlanta and Motorola, which both make boxes and other equipment used in cable systems.
