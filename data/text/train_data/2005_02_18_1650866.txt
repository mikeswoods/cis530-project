Stepping into the rapidly expanding business of providing information for wireless hand-held devices, Random House announced yesterday that it had acquired a minority stake in Vocel, a San Diego start-up company that offers educational content to subscribers over cellphones for a monthly fee.
Random House said it had also agreed to license two product lines -- Living Language, a series of foreign-language self-study programs, and Prima Games, which publishes video-game strategy guides -- to Vocel for use with its cellphone technology.
