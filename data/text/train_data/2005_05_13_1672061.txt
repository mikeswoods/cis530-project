The judge overseeing the criminal accounting fraud trial of the former HealthSouth chief executive Richard Scrushy dismissed two of the counts against him on Thursday.
But 36 others remain in the case, which could go to the jury as early as Monday. The remaining charges include mail fraud, wire fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy.
