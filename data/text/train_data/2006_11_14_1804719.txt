Arcelor Mittal, the steel giant based in Luxembourg, said Monday that a Dutch foundation would not let it sell the Canadian steel maker Dofasco to a rival, ThyssenKrupp of Germany.
If the foundation does not change its position, Arcelor Mittal will have to sell one of its two operations in the United States to address antitrust concerns. It may also face action from ThyssenKrupp.
