A group of investors led by J. Christopher Flowers, a former Goldman Sachs partner, withdrew its bid for the futures brokerage business of Refco late yesterday after a bankruptcy judge ruled that he would approve a sale only with a significantly lower breakup fee and a smaller reimbursement of fees.
Other bidders, however, emerged for the Refco unit, which Mr. Flowers had sought to acquire for $768 million. The Interactive Brokers Group offered $857.9 million, and a consortium led by the government of Dubai made a bid of $828 million. A group that includes Merrill Lynch, Warburg Pincus and Susquehanna International Group said it would be interested in the unit and would buy it without a breakup fee, but did not indicate a price. Other parties, including Apollo Management, the Man Group and Marathon Asset Management also stated their interest in the regulated entity.
