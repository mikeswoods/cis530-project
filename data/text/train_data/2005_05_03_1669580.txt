For accountants at PricewaterhouseCoopers, the audit of the American International Group has become a balancing act -- moving carefully to satisfy themselves and moving quickly to satisfy their client.
The auditors are at various A.I.G. units, reviewing the statements of a company coping with multiple investigations of its accounting. They are trying to make sure that they understand the transactions A.I.G. completed and that the accounting of the deals is correct -- for their protection as well as A.I.G.'s.
