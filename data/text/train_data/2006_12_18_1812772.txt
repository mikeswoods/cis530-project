The dialogue surrounding the Warner Brothers film ''Blood Diamond'' and its implicit criticism of the diamond industry took a new turn this month, as the hip-hop producer and entertainment mogul Russell Simmons returned from an industry-paid trip to Africa and began vocally defending the diamond trade.
The trip to Botswana and South Africa was largely paid for and organized by the Diamond Information Center, which handles public relations in the United States for the Diamond Trading Company, the marketing division of De Beers. Benjamin Chavis, a former executive director of the N.A.A.C.P. and a close associate of Mr. Simmons, who traveled to Africa with him, said the trip had been a long-planned project unrelated to the movie. (Mr. Simmons was out of the country on vacation and unavailable to comment.)
