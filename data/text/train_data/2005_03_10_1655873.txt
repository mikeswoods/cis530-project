A former New York Stock Exchange floor clerk was arrested yesterday and accused of passing on confidential information about trades to an unnamed day trader who made more than $300,000 on the illegally obtained information.
The clerk, Frank J. Furino, a 48-year-old former employee of Lawrence Helfant, which was acquired by the Jefferies Group investment bank in late 2001, was indicted on nine counts of securities fraud and commercial bribes. He pleaded not guilty in Federal District Court in Brooklyn and was released on a $300,000 bond.
