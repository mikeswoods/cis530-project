Allied Domecq said on Tuesday that it was in talks with Pernod Ricard of France and Fortune Brands of the United States about a buyout, a move that would revamp the $150-billion-a-year alcoholic beverage industry.
Together, Pernod and Fortune are working on a deal for Pernod to take control of Allied Domecq and Fortune Brands to provide some money for the takeover, executives involved in the negotiations said. In return, Fortune would receive some of Allied Domecq's brands, they said.
