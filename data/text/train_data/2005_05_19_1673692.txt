Inflation slowed in April from its fast pace in March, easing fears that the country might be headed toward a bout of surging prices even as the economy was slowing.
Prices still rose substantially last month. Energy prices pushed the Consumer Price Index up 0.5 percent after a 0.6 percent jump in March, the Labor Department reported. This pushed overall inflation in the last 12 months to 3.5 percent, the fastest clip since November.
