Down in Naples, Fla., a fast-growing city on the Gulf of Mexico, there was an auction of houses about a month ago.
An auction isn't the usual way to sell a home, but it can make sense for people who don't want to leave their houses on the market for months at a time and also don't want to take the first offer to come along. So on a Saturday morning inside the Naples Beach Hotel and Golf Club, a few dozen houses went on the block in front of about 500 bidders.
