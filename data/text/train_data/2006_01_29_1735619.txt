Soon, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., lawyer and environmental activist, will have a new job on his résumé: fashion model. In late February, Gant, the sportswear maker, will roll out an $8.5 million campaign featuring photographs of Mr. Kennedy, 52, his wife, Mary, and four of their six children, all doing active things that Kennedys tend to do.
Gant's goal is to align the East Coast roots of the preppy brand, founded in New Haven in 1949, with Mr. Kennedy's all-American, seafaring image. His environmental organization, the Waterkeeper Alliance, received a ''six-figure donation'' from Gant, Mr. Kennedy said. And at more than 200 Gant stores worldwide, Gant is offering polo shirts, sweatshirts and caps with the Waterkeeper Alliance logo (all proceeds go to the group).
