Following are excerpts from a report by a panel convened by CBS to investigate a Sept. 8 broadcast about President Bush's Vietnam-era service in the Texas Air National Guard. The report was based in part on documents said to be taken from the files of Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian, who was the commander of the squadron in which the president served from May 1968 to October 1973. The authenticity of those documents has been called into question. In response to the report, Viacom, the network's parent company, dismissed Mary Mapes, the longtime producer who had prepared the segment. It also demanded the resignations of three executives who had overseen the segment: Betsy West, a senior vice president and a top deputy to Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News; Josh Howard, the executive producer of the Wednesday edition of ''60 Minutes''; and Mary Murphy, his deputy.
