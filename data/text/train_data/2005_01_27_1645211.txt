Employees of Commerce Bancorp, which is based in Cherry Hill, N.J., and is one of the nation's fastest-growing banks, were pressured by their managers to contribute to a company-run political action committee every year and were encouraged to pad their expense accounts to cover the contributions, according to an amended lawsuit filed on Monday by Commerce stockholders.
The complaint, filed in Federal District Court in New Jersey, cited the comments of an unidentified former broker who worked in Commerce's capital markets unit from 1996 to 2004.
