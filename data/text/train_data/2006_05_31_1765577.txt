The Mirant Corporation, a power company that recently emerged from bankruptcy protection, said yesterday that it had made an unsolicited bid to buy NRG Energy for $7.8 billion. The announcement comes a week after NRG rejected a Mirant offer and declined to enter in takeover discussions.
Mirant, which is based in Atlanta, offered a combination of cash and shares that value NRG at $57.16 a share, or 33 percent more than the company's closing price of $43.01 on Tuesday. Mirant would also assume about $9 billion in debt and preferred securities.
