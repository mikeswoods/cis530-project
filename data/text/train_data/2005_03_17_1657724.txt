Viacom said yesterday that it was weighing a plan to divide its businesses into two public companies, a move that would unravel years of empire building by the chief executive, Sumner M. Redstone, while resolving the company's succession issues.
One company, led by Leslie Moonves, the co-president, would include CBS, its television stations, outdoor advertising and radio. The other, to be led by the co-president Tom Freston, would include MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime and the other cable networks. It would also include Paramount Pictures, Paramount Television and Simon & Schuster.
