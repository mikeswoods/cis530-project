After reports of illness and under pressure from major store chains, Bausch & Lomb said late yesterday that it had asked retailers across the nation to temporarily remove its ReNu With MoistureLoc contact lens solution from store shelves.
The company said that it was recommending that consumers switch to another lens care solution while health regulators investigate whether the product somehow caused 109 cases of fungal infections in contact lens users. The company said it would place advertisements in major newspapers today and Sunday to guide consumers on the alternatives.
