Although he's best known for helping people build their dream houses, the home improvement expert Bob Vila also helps filmmakers make their dream movies.
Interviewed at a party recently at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which is the host this month for programs with the Sundance Institute, Mr. Vila talked about why the Fledgling Fund, a foundation that he and his family established that focuses on improving health care for poor families, was giving grants to filmmakers. The reasoning, he said, was that films deliver messages with the power to influence policy and public opinion, so he likes to finance film projects that could have a salubrious effect on health care policy.
