Robert Allbritton, the chairman and chief executive of Riggs National Corporation, abruptly resigned last night.
Mr. Allbritton, 37, said he was leaving because of the bank's pending $652 million merger with PNC Financial Services Group. As the bank's executive committees have taken a more active role since December, Mr. Allbritton has seen his responsibilities vanish. According to an individual close to the bank, he made the decision to leave after conversations with some committee members over the last few days.
