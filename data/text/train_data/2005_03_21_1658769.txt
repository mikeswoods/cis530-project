Serious fans of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' will find nothing new on an upcoming DVD release of the show's first two episodes from 1997. Priced at just $9.98, this TV starter set is being released tomorrow as a marketing gambit by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment to attract new customers -- a kind of Buffy for beginners.
The company hopes consumers will become so enamored of the shows that they will purchase entire seasons on DVD at considerably higher prices.
