Sergei A. Zuykov is a lawyer for Starbucks in Russia. Only the Starbucks he represents brews no coffee and owns no shops. Its business consists of trying to sell its name back to the other Starbucks -- the better-known company from Seattle.
A tall, strapping 39-year-old former car alarm salesman turned trademark squatter, Mr. Zuykov has stalled Starbucks' entry into one of the fastest growing retail markets in Europe while competitors, both homegrown and international brands, have been springing up like mushrooms after the rain.
