Critics of efforts by Nielsen Media Research to change the way it measures television ratings have met with a setback from the Federal Trade Commission, which says it sees no reason to assume oversight of Nielsen or how ratings data are gathered.
''Absent deceptive or unfair practices, it would not be within the commission's authority to impose quality standards for accuracy in audience measurement,'' Deborah Platt Majoras, the chairwoman of the commission, wrote in a letter to Representative Albert Wynn, a Minnesota Democrat. The letter was released yesterday by Nielsen, part of VNU.
