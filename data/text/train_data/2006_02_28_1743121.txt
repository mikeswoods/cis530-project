WE have a getaway place in Tucson, near Saguaro National Park. Usually, we've noticed, the coyotes get to yowling around 4:30 in the morning. There must be a thousand of them in the desert and the Rincon foothills, and why they set up this commotion just before dawn is a question I cannot answer. The yowling chorus lasts no more than a minute. Then, inexplicably, they stop, the desert solitude returns and we drift back to sleep.
Clang! It's a few minutes after 4 a.m., and I accidentally let the iron front gate bang shut as I lug a suitcase out to the rental car. I haven't had coffee and my mood is as dark as the moon-limned landscape.
