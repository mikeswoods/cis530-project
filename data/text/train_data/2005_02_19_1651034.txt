As corporate America celebrates the legislation on class-action lawsuits signed by the president yesterday as a victory in the battle to limit civil lawsuits, some evidence has surfaced that jury verdicts -- another oft-cited villain in debates over problems with the civil justice system -- may have leveled off and perhaps even declined.
In the 100 biggest verdicts of 2004, juries assessed a total of $11.1 billion in damages, down from $20.1 billion in 2003 and $40 billion (a result of a $28 billion tobacco verdict) in 2002, according to The National Law Journal, which drew on data assembled by VerdictSearch; both are units of American Lawyer Media. The 100 cases include class-action lawsuits in state and federal courts that went to a jury.
