The music has stopped, at least for the time being, at a much-heralded music magazine, Tracks.
Tracks, which proclaimed its focus to be ''music for grown-ups'' -- that is, people 30 and over -- is going on hiatus, John Rollins, the chief executive, based in New York, said Friday, as additional money is sought. An issue with a June/July cover date that was to be readied for publication will not be printed, he added, because ''if we don't have the cash, we can't put out the next issue.''
