I ALWAYS pack a supply of playthings like hand puppets and puzzles when I'm on the road. They've saved the day for me more than a few times. You never know when you're going to get stuck on a flight next to an inconsolable toddler or a teething baby whose ears start hurting when the plane is pressurized.
To these young passengers, I reflexively offer my toys.
