I started flying young, if accidentally, in 1947 on propeller planes such as Dakotas and Super Constellations. The summer I was 15, I traveled with my mother by boat and train to Montreux, Switzerland, where she was born, for vacation. At summer's end she returned to the United States and I stayed on to attend a French language and literature class for foreign students at the local high school.
In December, when the semester ended, I took a train to Paris and the next day to Le Havre where I was supposed to take a boat. The French labor unions went on strike and since the transportation workers were involved, the boat didn't leave. On the third day, the steamship line transported all passengers back to Paris. There were reports of tanks in the streets and rumors of a Communist takeover.
