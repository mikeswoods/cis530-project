With airline perks going the way of the dodo, here's one way to get a little extra for the price of your ticket. The Inflight Power recharger uses the trickle of electricity coming from your airplane seat's headphone jack to charge iPods and other portable devices.
The Inflight Power cable has a  1/8-inch headphone plug on one end and a U.S.B. jack on the other. When plugged into your seat's headphone jack, the cable turns the electricity coming from the plane's audio system into usable power. Adapters compatible with iPods, BlackBerries and any of about 700 other devices allow you to recharge almost every hand-held gadget known to man. Your devices will charge much more slowly than when connected to a regular outlet, but if the flight is long enough that may not matter.
