A NEW e-book tells a ''sordid story'' of business fraud, according to one reviewer. The book's author says it is ''the largest fraud case in American history.''
Enron? WorldCom? No. It's much, much larger than either of those, though the use of the word ''fraud'' in this case is more a literary device than a legal definition. The book is ''The $200 Billion Broadband Scandal'' (newnetworks.com). The author is Bruce Kushnick, a longtime irritant to the telecommunications industry.
