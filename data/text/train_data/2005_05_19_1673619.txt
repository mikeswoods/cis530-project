Fresh details have emerged in court papers about the inner workings of a private offshore company that had been paying big bonuses to top executives of the insurance giant American International Group.
The company, Starr International, awarded tens of millions of dollars in payouts over a two-year period at a time when it was ineligible to do so under its own operating laws, according to the court papers, which cite internal A.I.G. documents.
