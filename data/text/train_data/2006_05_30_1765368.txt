I'm 6-foot, 11-inches tall -- not the tallest guy to have played in the N.B.A., but I still tower over the average traveler. I'm on the road about 200 days a year, trying to contend with airline seats and hotel rooms that, to be honest, were not built with professional basketball players in mind.
Don't get me wrong: I love to travel, especially during the N.B.A. playoffs.
