Cablevision Systems said yesterday that the board had agreed to give its chairman and founder, Charles F. Dolan, and a son, Thomas, until the end of the month to acquire the assets of its Voom high-definition television operation.
The company was careful to say that the board, which met Monday and again yesterday, approved the move and that Charles Dolan had agreed to finance any costs Cablevision incurred beyond the expenses that would have arisen under its plan to shut down the service.
