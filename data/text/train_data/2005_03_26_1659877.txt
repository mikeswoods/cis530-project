The Italian government will sell a 5.2 billion euro stake ($6.7 billion) in Enel, the biggest utility here, to reduce the country's staggering debt.
The finance ministry said late Thursday that it would lower its stake in Enel to about 20 percent from a 31.5 percent stake by selling shares to Italian and foreign investment funds, as well as individual investors, by the end of September.
