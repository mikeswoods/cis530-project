In another move against foreign oil companies, Venezuela's populist government said Monday that it had taken control of fields operated by two European energy giants after they challenged new rules that give the state extensive control over 32 mostly marginal fields that, until now, had been managed by foreign multinationals.
The action, which happened Saturday, takes over fields from Total of France and Eni of Italy and it came just days after Venezuela's energy minister, Rafael Ram√≠rez, publicly said that Exxon Mobil was not welcome in Venezuela after a dispute over the company's stake in the minor Quiamare-La Ceiba field.
