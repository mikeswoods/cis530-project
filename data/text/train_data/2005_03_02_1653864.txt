Verizon Communications would and should face serious regulatory hurdles in its bid to acquire MCI, Richard C. Notebaert, the chief executive of Qwest Communications, told investors yesterday.
Mr. Notebaert made his remarks in New York as part of an effort to persuade Wall Street investors and analysts that MCI would be better off rejecting Verizon as a suitor and accepting Qwest as a merger partner.
