A dispute between the Interpublic Group of Companies and Bruce Nelson, the senior executive who oversees one of its biggest accounts, has become public, not long after the account was placed in review.
For several weeks, there had been speculation that Mr. Nelson, who since 2002 has overseen the work that 16 Interpublic agencies do for the Bank of America Corporation, was seeking to leave his post as executive vice president and chief marketing officer. But no one would discuss the matter publicly until Friday, a week after the bank announced the review. Mr. Nelson then told Adweek.com that he would resign over what he termed a disagreement in principle about how the account ought to be managed.
