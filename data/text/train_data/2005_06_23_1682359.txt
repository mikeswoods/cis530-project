The head of Sony, Sir Howard Stringer, on Wednesday promised shareholders a fresh plan to revamp the company and halt the long slide in its stock price as he formally became Sony's first foreign chief executive.
Sir Howard, 63, said his executive team would draft a plan by September to increase Sony's profit by rebuilding the core electronics division, which has been battered by new competitors and rapidly falling prices on flat-panel television, digital cameras and other products.
