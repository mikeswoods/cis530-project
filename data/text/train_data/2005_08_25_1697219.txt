State and federal officials in Connecticut are investigating the possible collapse of the Bayou Group, a hedge fund and brokerage firm in Stamford that managed an estimated $400 million for its investors, according to two people briefed on the investigation.
Clients of the Bayou Group apparently grew concerned about the firm's status in recent days, when refund checks it had sent to customers could not be drawn upon for lack of funds, one of the two people briefed on the investigation said. In addition, telephones at Bayou went unanswered.
