A survey of the world's biggest companies shows that the turnover of chief executives at American companies has held relatively steady for the last few years, while the pace of management departures has accelerated overseas.
The findings suggest that increased shareholder activism and a new vigilance among corporate boards in the United States has had only a muted impact on top executive turnover. In Europe and most of Asia, boards were generally quicker to remove an underperforming manager.
