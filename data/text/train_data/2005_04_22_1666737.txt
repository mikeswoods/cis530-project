Pernod Ricard of France plans to use its $14 billion purchase of Allied Domecq as a springboard to become the world's largest liquor company, challenging the top-ranked Diageo, Pernod executives said Thursday.
The deal could ignite more consolidation in the industry, as smaller players rush to buy their rivals or risk being bought up themselves, analysts said.
