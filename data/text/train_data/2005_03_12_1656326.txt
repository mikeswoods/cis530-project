Buy a T-shirt at Wal-Mart, fleece sweats at J.C. Penney or Hanes panties anywhere in the United States, and there's a halfway decent chance that they were stitched together here, in an acre-size garment factory crammed with thousands of frantically clacking sewing machines. Virtually its entire output, 25,000 items of clothing daily, is America-bound.
These days, that is a disaster. ''Two thousand people work here, and unfortunately last week I had to retrench 500 people, because there are no orders,'' Boodia Heman, director of the Ever Unison Garments factory, said in a recent interview. ''The American buyer is not coming to Lesotho to buy.''
