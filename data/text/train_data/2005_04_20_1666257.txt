The Los Angeles Times said on Tuesday that it had dismissed a reporter after an internal inquiry could not verify the sources of some quotations and found numerous errors in an article about fraternity hazing and the death of a student at a state university.
The newspaper announced the dismissal of the reporter, Eric Slater, at the end of an editor's note in its Tuesday issue. The note said that the article, which was published on March 29, relied on poor reporting techniques, used quotations from anonymous sources whom editors could not verify and included a string of factual errors.
