THE soporific effects of alcohol have spoiled many a late night by eroding an otherwise devoted partygoer's resolve to dance, chat or flirt until the sun comes up. Creative imbibers have done their best to counter this problem by mixing their vodka with Red Bull, the Austrian energy tonic. The results are a cocktail that provides a jolt in concert with its liquor buzz, but can also be sickly sweet; a can of Red Bull has 27 grams of sugar, 8 more than a Twinkie.
David Mandell first noticed his aversion to the taste of this combination in early 2004, as he quaffed the concoction at a stylish Los Angeles bar. Their tongues loosened by a few drinks, Mr. Mandell and a friend wondered whether vodka itself could be caffeinated, then paired with a familiar mixer like tonic.
