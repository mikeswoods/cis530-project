In its biggest privatization deal to date, the government of Ukraine sold the country's largest steel mill for $4.8 billion to the steel magnate Lakshmi N. Mittal, the world's third-richest person.
Mittal Steel, which is largely controlled by Mr. Mittal and his family, will buy 93 percent of the Kryvorizhstal mill in the southern part of Ukraine. The mill shipped 6.7 million tons of steel in 2004.
