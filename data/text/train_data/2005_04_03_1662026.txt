HOW many leveraged buyout firms does it take to do a deal?
Evidently, quite a few. Last week, seven of the nation's most prominent private equity firms crowded into one deal, teaming up to buy SunGard Data Systems for $11.3 billion. It was the largest leveraged buyout since Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company bought RJR Nabisco in 1989 for $25 billion.
