The grumpy old men just got grumpier. After more than a month of silence, a dissident group of retired Morgan Stanley executives described in greater detail their proposal to split the firm in two, in a further assault on the leadership of Philip J. Purcell.
But the plan, which has already been spurned by the Morgan Stanley board, carries with it two ambitious and uncertain assumptions. The first is the dissidents' assertion that five senior executives who resigned last month amid a management shake-up by Mr. Purcell will return to Morgan Stanley. The second is that shareholder support for the split will be strong enough either to force recalcitrant directors to agree to it, or to goad them into ousting Mr. Purcell as chief executive.
