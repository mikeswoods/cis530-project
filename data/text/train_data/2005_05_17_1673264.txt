New federal traffic safety statistics released Monday suggest that pickup truck occupants who do not wear seat belts are at a greater risk of dying in traffic accidents than unbelted occupants in cars.
Previous research has shown that people in pickup trucks wear their seat belts less frequently than car occupants. But the new numbers also show for the first time that seat belts play a more critical role in preventing accident deaths in pickup trucks than in cars.
