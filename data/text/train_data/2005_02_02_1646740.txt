A former financial officer for HealthSouth said in court Tuesday that he made up numbers to increase company results starting in 1996, and that he did so under the direct orders of Richard M. Scrushy, the company's former chief executive.
Mr. Scrushy is charged with directing a $2.7 billion accounting fraud at HealthSouth from 1996 to 2002. The former financial officer, William T. Owens, who is testifying for the government as part of a plea agreement, said Tuesday that his role was to determine how to produce fraudulent statements, which were ultimately reviewed and approved by Mr. Scrushy.
