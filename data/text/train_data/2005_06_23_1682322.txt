In a widely anticipated move, the Toronto-Dominion Bank agreed on Wednesday to sell its TD Waterhouse USA brokerage unit to the Ameritrade Holding Corporation in a stock-and-cash deal valued at about $3.3 billion.
Under the terms of the sale, Ameritrade stockholders will receive a special $6 a share dividend. Toronto-Dominion will acquire a 32 percent stake in the combined operation, which will be known as TD Ameritrade.
