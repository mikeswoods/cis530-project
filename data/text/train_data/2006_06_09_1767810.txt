Airbus and the Chinese government announced late Thursday that they had selected Tianjin, a port near Beijing, as the site for an assembly plant to build A320 narrow-body jets.
Airbus cautioned that a final decision on the project would not be made until the end of September. But the selection of Tianjin is the latest in a series of steps by Airbus toward establishing its first aircraft assembly operation outside Europe, with the goal of catching up with Boeing in the fast-growing Chinese market.
