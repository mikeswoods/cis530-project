Alex Bogusky, the 42-year-old creative director of the advertising agency Crispin Porter & Bogusky, is somewhat beleaguered. Sitting in his cluttered office here, surrounded by masks he created for Burger King and other memorabilia from years of ad-making, he recalled a ''battle of the bands'' at Advertising Week in New York a few weeks earlier. Agencies had pitted their in-house rock bands against each other, and the Crispin band had not been treated well.
''People were cursing and throwing beer at us,'' Mr. Bogusky said. ''It's bumming me out. It makes me want to get out of the business.''
