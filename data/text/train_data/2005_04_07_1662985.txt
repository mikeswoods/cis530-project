In one of the largest discrimination awards to a single plaintiff on record, UBS, Europe's largest bank, was ordered by a federal jury in New York to pay more than $29 million in damages to a former saleswoman who sued the firm for sex discrimination.
After a three-year trial, Laura Zubulake, 44, was awarded $20.1 million in punitive damages plus $9.1 million in compensatory damages after the jury decided that the bank mistreated her because she was a woman and then fired her after she complained to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
