Investigators nicknamed the gang of shoplifters the Ghali organization after its leader, Mohammed K. Ghali, and organized it was. Every day, gang members stole, repackaged and resold up to $2,000 in infant formula, diabetes test strips, razor blades and nicotine gum from stores across northern Texas.
The gang controlled convenience stores to stockpile the merchandise and a warehouse to distribute it, according to court records. To keep morale up, leaders showered shoplifters with perks, from free transportation to bail money, as needed.
