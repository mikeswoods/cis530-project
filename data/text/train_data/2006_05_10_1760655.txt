A senior federal prosecutor said yesterday that a move by the accounting firm KPMG to cut off legal fees to employees caught up in a criminal investigation of the firm over tax shelters played no role in the government's decision not to indict the firm.
The testimony by the prosecutor, Shirah Neiman, the chief counsel to the United States attorney in Manhattan who supervised the investigation of KPMG, came after a top lawyer for KPMG testified that the firm had cut off legal fees to show prosecutors that it was cooperating with their investigation into its sales of questionable tax shelters.
