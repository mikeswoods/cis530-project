The Boeing Company's chief executive, Harry C. Stonecipher, said yesterday that he expected that Boeing and the federal government could move as early as the end of this month toward reaching a settlement of several ethics investigations into the company's dealings with the Pentagon.
Speaking at a New York investors' conference, Mr. Stonecipher said that a settlement would probably occur after the Feb. 18 sentencing of a former Boeing chief financial officer, Michael M. Sears, a central figure in a conflict-of-interest scandal involving Boeing and billions of dollars in Pentagon contracts.
