TO reintroduce a struggling brand, the Campbell Soup Company is giving consumers a song and dance -- literally.
A campaign that began this week for the Campbell's Select line of higher-priced soups features the actor John Lithgow singing and dancing in commercials that offer humorous tributes to the brand. The campaign, carrying the theme ''Why settle when you can Select,'' is being created by BBDO Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group.
