The Walt Disney Company has decided to give up on popular science, after all. The company's publishing group has decided to sell Discover magazine to concentrate on its other, family-friendly titles, FamilyFun, Disney Adventure and Disney. The investment bank Veronis Suhler Stevenson will handle the sale.
Discover, a general-interest science magazine covering topics like archaeological finds, viruses and new animal species, was acquired by Disney in 1991. Glenn Rosenbloom, a vice president of Buena Vista Magazines, which is a subsidiary of Disney Publishing Worldwide, said that Discover's advertising revenue increased 20 percent in 2004 over the previous year but was ''off a few percentage points'' at the start of this year.
