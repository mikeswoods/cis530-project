WHEN I was at Coe College, I did an internship with the Cedar Rapids, Iowa, visitors bureau. A friend from my fraternity told me about it. I had always been intrigued with the notion of vacations and travel. The only vacations my family took were to the Iowa State Fair for a couple of days. My father couldn't leave the farm. He worked day and night. And all of a sudden I'm involved in an industry that's all about vacations.
I loved it. When the executive director told me about a job in Davenport, R.I., as executive director of that city's convention bureau, I applied for it and got it. After a year, I went on to run the convention and visitors bureau in Providence.
