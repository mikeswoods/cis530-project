General Motors' largest shareholder is pressing the troubled American auto giant to speed up its turnaround effort by forming an alliance with two foreign car companies, Nissan and Renault, which would pay $3 billion for a 20 percent stake in G.M.
The proposal by the billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, suggested in letters to the three companies, is his latest effort to put pressure on G.M.'s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, to quicken the pace of change.
