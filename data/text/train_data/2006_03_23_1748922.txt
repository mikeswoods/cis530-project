A Canadian government panel has called for the elimination of foreign ownership restrictions on telecommunications companies as well as the deregulation of telephone and Internet services.
The report by the Telecommunications Policy Review Panel, released Wednesday, outlines a plan for gradually reducing the limits on foreign control of telephone companies, after an examination of similar restrictions on Canadian broadcasters and cable operators.
