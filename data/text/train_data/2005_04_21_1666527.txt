Noise-killing headphones once came in just two designs: large and expensive over-the-ear models with active noise-cancellation technology, and even more expensive in-ear models that form seals to block noise naturally.
Available in May, the SoundShield compact headphones from Brookstone ($150) -- with a built-in equalizer, adjustable headband and hard-shell case -- offer a compromise. The four-ounce set is about the size of the over-the-ear headphones that came with the Walkman of the 1980's, and it provides the comfort of large, active noise-canceling models as well as the passive noise isolation of in-ear models.
