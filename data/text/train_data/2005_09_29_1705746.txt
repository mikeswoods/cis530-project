Russia's state-owned natural gas giant Gazprom said Wednesday that it would buy Sibneft, the country's fifth-largest oil company, for $13.09 billion, further extending the Kremlin's control of major oil producers here.
Gazprom and Millhouse Capital, the holding company of the billionaire Roman A. Abramovich, jointly announced the sale of a 72.6 percent stake in Sibneft. Gazprom already held a 3 percent stake in Sibneft through its banking arm. Another 20 percent of Sibneft stock is tied up in arbitration in London after a failed merger with the Yukos oil company.
