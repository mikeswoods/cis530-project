Regulators are examining whether the American International Group has in recent years burnished its results by striking deals with offshore insurers that appear to be independent companies but that may in fact be affiliates of A.I.G. If these companies are indeed A.I.G.'s affiliates, the transactions between them may not involve a true transfer of risk and may run afoul of insurance accounting rules.
The companies drawing scrutiny are Richmond Insurance and Union Excess Reinsurance, reinsurers that, according to regulatory filings, do business solely with A.I.G. Both are registered in Barbados, an offshore tax haven that is loosely regulated. Another offshore insurer that counts A.I.G. as its only customer is Pillar Insurance, also of Barbados.
