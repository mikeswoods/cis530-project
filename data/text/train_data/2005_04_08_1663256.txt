The government's decision to force Pfizer to withdraw the pain drug Bextra and add warnings to the label of a similar drug, Celebrex, has galvanized the informal network of lawyers pursuing death and injury suits aimed at the two drugs and their chemical relative, Vioxx.
Yesterday, at least one new Bextra suit was filed against Pfizer in Houston, adding to a smattering of others from around the country in the last year. And a Louisiana lawyer, anticipating a flood of new suits, filed a motion calling for consolidation of federal Bextra and Celebrex cases.
