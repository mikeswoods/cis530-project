The judge in the criminal trial of Bernard J. Ebbers, the former WorldCom chief executive, told jurors yesterday that they did not need to consider the size and scope of the WorldCom fraud in reaching a verdict on the charges of filing false claims that Mr. Ebbers faces.
Late in the afternoon, the jurors sent a note to Judge Barbara S. Jones of United States District Court in Manhattan asking for clarification on how to interpret several supplemental allegations, which are related to seven counts of filing false claims with securities regulators.
