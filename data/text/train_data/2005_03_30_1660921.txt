The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday gave companies wide latitude in calculating the expense to be recorded for stock options issued to executives and other employees. The move may enable companies to keep reported costs low as they adapt to an accounting rule that requires options costs to be treated like any other expense.
''They are allowing a lot of flexibility in the accounting,'' said Michael A. Moran, an accounting analyst at Goldman, Sachs. But, he added, the S.E.C. also made it clear that it expected companies to disclose details about what they did, to make it possible for investors to evaluate the accounting.
