For the first time in the four-week trial of two former Enron executives, the actions of the company's directors in a critical month in 2001 came under scrutiny during a cross-examination.
The scrutiny came as a defense lawyer for the founder of Enron, Kenneth L. Lay, sought to defuse testimony from a former corporate secretary, Paula H. Rieker. He pushed her to admit that directors had blessed the actions of Mr. Lay and the former chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, that were related to financial structures set up by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer.
