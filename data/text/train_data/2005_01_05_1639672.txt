Apex Digital, the electronic goods company based in California that has been accused by one of China's biggest television makers of causing it huge financial losses, has fought back against the charges, claiming the Chinese company was involved in detaining and apparently pressuring Apex's president.
In court documents that are Apex Digital's first extensive response to the accusations, company executives say that the television maker, Sichuan Changhong Electric, falsely stated that Apex had failed to make payments owed Changhong, and that Changhong required Apex's president, David Ji, to sign agreements unfavorable to Apex while held under arrest.
