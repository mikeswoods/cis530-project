A new auditing regulator in Britain said yesterday that it had found problems in some audits conducted by the Big Four accounting firms, reflecting a failure to apply proper procedures. It said it had discovered two audited companies that it believed had not complied with all rules.
''The firms are capable of doing very good audits,'' Paul George, director of the Professional Oversight Board for Accountancy, said yesterday in a telephone interview. ''But we identify some areas where they are not applying their procedures and practices across all audits.''
