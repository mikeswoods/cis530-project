TAX reform, like a second marriage, is the triumph of hope over experience. The United States has just gone through the most sweeping tax cuts since the 1980's, but hardly anybody is satisfied. President Bush contends that we need still-lower taxes in order to prosper. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is suggesting a radical shift to a consumption tax. And the Republican Party has taken aim at the entire tax system.
At the heart of such antitax sentiment is this belief: Taxes are bad for the economy. And who would disagree, especially as April 15 nears?
