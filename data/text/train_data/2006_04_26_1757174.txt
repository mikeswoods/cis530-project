Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's former chairman and chief executive, remained defiant on Tuesday, blaming Enron's former chief financial officer and newspaper articles for causing the market panic that led to the company's downfall, while saying there were no underlying problems with the business.
In his second day on the stand in his criminal fraud trial, Mr. Lay blamed Andrew S. Fastow, the former chief financial officer, for profiting from improper transactions, and asserted that The Wall Street Journal had conducted a ''witch hunt'' against Mr. Fastow and Enron.
