WHEN Berkshire Hathaway shareholders gather here in three weeks for their annual meeting, they will be treated to another homespun video starring the company's chairman, Warren E. Buffett. This year's plot is still a secret, but Mr. Buffett's co-star in last year's video was Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor of California.
Mr. Schwarzenegger appeared in Army fatigues and took Mr. Buffett -- who may be the Charles Atlas of investors but who has the musculature of a chipmunk -- through a grueling workout to punish him for criticizing inequities in California's property tax system. At the end of the video, Mr. Buffett graces the cover of a fitness magazine, sporting six-pack abs and rippling biceps, much to the governor's surprise.
