Allan Elias, a vice president at a family-owned clothing maker in New York's garment district, had what he called ''a very serious problem.'' Dillard's Inc., the big department store chain, had withheld thousands of dollars from payments for clothes he had shipped. He did not want to lose an important client, but money was money. His letter to Dillard's was almost pleading.
''Dillard's is a valued customer,'' he wrote, ''and we are anxious to continue and grow the Dillard's business, but the excess deductions of $222,061.25 that have been taken are simply unacceptable.'' Altogether, he said, Dillard's had deducted 51 percent from the cost of five months' orders, much more than they had agreed upon.
