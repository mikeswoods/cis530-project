Michelle Kwan has never won an Olympics gold medal. But that has not stopped her from grabbing several long-term commercial endorsement deals that typically only go to those athletes who bring home the gold.
As Ms. Kwan gears up for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy --probably the last chance for the 25-year-old figure skater -- she has already lined up major deals with Coca-Cola, Visa and East West Bank. She will be the lead Olympian in Coke's 2006 Olympic advertising plans, which include commercials on network and cable television as well as a major in-store promotional effort by Coke. Her image will be stamped on promotions for 14 Coke brands, including Dasani and Minute Maid.
