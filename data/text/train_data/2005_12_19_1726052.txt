Rob Newell spends his days fixing high-speed Internet connections. But when he returns to his home office here in western Maine, a two-hour drive from Portland, Mr. Newell is forced to use an abysmally slow dial-up connection that takes hours to download material he needs for business and makes it impossible to fix clients' computers remotely.
''It's quite difficult,'' said Mr. Newell, who owns Newell Consulting, a computer networking company. He cannot get high-speed Internet access from the phone company because the nearest central office, in Farmington, is 10 miles away, too far to maintain a connection. Hooking up his house by satellite would cost about $800 a month, he said. Any time he has to download new programs to upgrade his computer devices, he said, ''it's almost unfeasible.''
