The takeover fight for MCI took another twist yesterday when the chairmen of Qwest Communications and Verizon Communications both released letters stating their cases for being permitted to buy the troubled long-distance carrier.
Qwest's chairman, Richard C. Notebaert, sent a letter to MCI expressing his concern that his company's latest bid was being ignored. That came a few hours after Ivan G. Seidenberg, Verizon's chairman, made public a 10-page letter that dismissed Qwest's projected cost savings from an MCI purchase as ''modern fiction.''
