WHILE many travelers are still happy to spend their vacations lollygagging on the beach, more and more of them want to learn something on their trips. Last spring, Cher Compton left her husband at home in Naples, Fla., and went to the south of Spain with three of her riding friends to practice dressage on Andalusian horses with instruction from local masters.
At the Epona Equestrian Center near Carmona, Ms. Compton had a daily lesson, a lovely room in the hacienda and meals on a patio. What she didn't expect was the cultural richness. On morning trail rides, she and her friends came across olive groves, a Roman bridge and farmers tending their land. In other words, ''the history of the place,'' said Ms. Compton, 54, who is the executive director of a nonprofit organization. ''It gave us real insight into old Spain.''
