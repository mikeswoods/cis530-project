The stock market rose modestly last week as energy prices declined and a number of companies issued optimistic earnings reports.
The price of oil fell for five consecutive days in New York, reaching $53.32 a barrel on Friday, the lowest close since early March, amid indications that gasoline supplies in the United States would be enough for the peak summer driving season. In a report on Wednesday, the Energy Department said that oil stocks in the United States had risen over the previous eight weeks.
