THE New York office of Saatchi & Saatchi, scrambling to recover from the loss of 17 employees who worked for an important client, General Mills, has lured a top creative executive from a competitor to help rebuild the team.
Ann Hayden, who has been the executive creative director for the last five years at the New York office of Young & Rubicam, part of the Young & Rubicam Brands division of the WPP Group, is leaving to join Saatchi New York as the worldwide creative director for the General Mills account.
