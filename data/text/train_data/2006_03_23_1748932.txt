Thomas H. Lee, the colorful financier who founded the buyout firm Thomas H. Lee Partners, said yesterday that he had stepped down from the firm as part of a long-arranged succession plan and would seek new opportunities in private equity and hedge funds.
The separation ends several years of planning and months of negotiations and speculation over the terms of his departure. As part of his agreement to step down, he will no longer hold an interest in any of the firm's future funds but he will be able to call his new venture Thomas H. Lee Capital.
