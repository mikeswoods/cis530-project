BMW of North America, which last year purchased office property in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., from the Ingersoll-Rand Company to expand its own headquarters there, will begin construction of an ''environmentally sensitive'' building on the property some time next year, according to the division's chief executive, Tom Purves.
Mr. Purves said his company chose the New York architecture firm HOK, formerly known as Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, to design a training and engineering center, after an ''intense international competition.'' Mr. Purves said he was thrilled with a preliminary rendering of a low-slung, modernistic glass-and-steel structure that hugs the contour of the land.
