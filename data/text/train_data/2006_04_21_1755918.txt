CBS Radio and XM Satellite Radio are in talks to replace David Lee Roth, the morning host on seven CBS stations, with Opie and Anthony, the foulmouthed talk team that has been marquee talent on XM for the last 18 months, according to executives at both companies.
In an unusual arrangement that is being closely watched in the radio industry, the deal would split Opie and Anthony's show between satellite and terrestrial stations. For three hours each weekday, Opie and Anthony would do a cleaner version of their usual show -- one acceptable under broadcast standards -- for the CBS audience, produced in the Midtown Manhattan studios of WFNY (92.3 FM), a CBS station. That portion of the show would also be heard on XM.
