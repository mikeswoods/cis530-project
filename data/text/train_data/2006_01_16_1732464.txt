MARKETING movies is about finding an audience. But what if an audience does not want to be found?
This was the problem facing Sony Pictures Classics, which is distributing Tommy Lee Jones's ''The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada,'' a bilingual film about a Texas ranch hand (Mr. Jones) who forces a border-patrol guard (Barry Pepper), who killed an undocumented Mexican worker, to escort the body back to Mexico. Not surprisingly, one of this film's target audiences is Mexican immigrants -- both legal and illegal.
