Under pressure from civil rights groups, ABC Television yesterday canceled plans to broadcast a reality show that let the white suburban families living on a Texas cul-de-sac decide which of seven families -- including one black, one Asian, one Hispanic and one gay couple -- would move into their community.
The show, ''Welcome to the Neighborhood,'' was to be a summer replacement for the top-rated ''Desperate Housewives,'' which is set on a fictional cul-de-sac, Wisteria Lane, where no one can keep her nose out of anyone else's business.
