Deep in a basement lab at the University of Toronto a team of political scientists, software engineers and computer-hacking activists, or ''hactivists,'' have created the latest, and some say most advanced tool yet in allowing Internet users to circumvent government censorship of the Web.
The program, called psiphon (pronounced ''SY-fon''), will be released on Dec. 1 in response to growing Internet censorship that is pushing citizens in restrictive countries to pursue more elaborate and sophisticated programs to gain access to Western news sites, blogs and other censored material.
