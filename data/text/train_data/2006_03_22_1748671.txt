The acquisition and subsequent redevelopment of a former Pfizer pharmaceutical research facility here by Forest City, the Cleveland-based developer, promises to quadruple the amount of speculative office space available for biotechnology companies in the Chicago area.
Forest City bought the one-million-square-foot complex last spring for $43 million. Since then, the company has demolished 9 of the 13 buildings on the 23-acre campus, leaving about 700,000 square feet of offices and laboratories. The company plans to build an additional 1.3 million square feet of new space, also for offices and labs, over the next 10 years. Over all, the project is expected to cost more than $500 million.
