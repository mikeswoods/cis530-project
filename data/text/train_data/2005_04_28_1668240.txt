European Union officials stepped up pressure Wednesday on Italy's banking chief, Antonio Fazio, amid signs that Italy is trying to hinder the Dutch bank ABN Amro in its efforts to buy an Italian bank.
The European Union's competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, wrote to Mr. Fazio Tuesday expressing concern over Italy's decision to limit ABN's stake in Banca Antonveneta to 20 percent while allowing a domestic rival, Banca Popolare di Lodi, to own nearly 30 percent, her spokesman, Jonathan Todd, said.
