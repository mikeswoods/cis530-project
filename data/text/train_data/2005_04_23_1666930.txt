Profit at Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications equipment giant, soared 73 percent in the first quarter, the company said Friday, building on a recent run of healthy reports in the telecommunications industry.
The company, the world's largest supplier of mobile phone networks, said that first-quarter net income increased to 4.64 billion kronor ($660 million). Sales were up 12 percent from a year before, to 31.5 billion kronor, as Ericsson introduced third-generation services in Western Europe, and demand for wide-band code-division multiple access, or WCDMA, increased in Eastern Europe and Turkey.
