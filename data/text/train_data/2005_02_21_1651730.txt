A few years ago, Warner Brothers sold the video game rights to its film series ''The Matrix,'' a heady science-fiction trilogy starring Keanu Reeves, for $10 million, according to industry reports.
So when it came time for Warner Brothers to sell the game rights to ''Constantine,'' the new fantasy movie also starring Keanu Reeves, the studio might have expected a similar windfall. Instead, the rights went to a small developer, Bits Studios, for less than a million dollars.
