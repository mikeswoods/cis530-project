The defense in the Enron trial limped into its case on Monday. One of its lead defense lawyers was back in a hospital instead of in court, and the opening lineup of five witnesses offered little testimony to challenge charges against the chief executives, Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling.
Michael W. Ramsey, the lead lawyer for Mr. Lay, the former Enron chairman, will undergo more heart surgery on Tuesday after tests on Monday found problems with an arterial stent put in place on March 24, Kelly Kimberly, a spokeswoman for Mr. Lay, said in a statement.
