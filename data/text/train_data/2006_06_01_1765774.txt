The more pills you take, the more you need to know about them when you're gadding about. Is it time to take this pill now? Will the dish I'm about to eat cause a bad interaction? If I've missed a pill, should I take one now, double up next time or simply skip it?
The Rx Master from Excalibur Electronics will tell you all that and more. The pocket-size device ($30 at excaliburelectronics.com and other online stores) can remind you when doses are due, keep track of what you've taken and even carry your pills in a four-compartment drawer.
