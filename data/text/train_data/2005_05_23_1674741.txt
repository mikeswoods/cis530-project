KPRC-AM, a small talk radio station in Houston, has suspended ''Newsweek on Air,'' a syndicated hourlong program, in reaction to Newsweek magazine's report, now retracted, that a military investigation found that interrogators at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, flushed a Koran down a toilet.
''I subscribe to Newsweek,'' said Ken Charles, program director at KPRC, which is part of the Clear Channel Radio division of Clear Channel Communications. ''I just want to hear what they're fully going to put in place to prevent this sort of thing from happening again.''
