Bratz, a line of dolls whose curvy figures and up-to-the-minute fashions have turned it into a $2.5 billion global brand, has discovered a threat even bigger than Barbie: 12-year-old girls like Ashley Rivera. A member of the first generation to embrace Bratz, which reached the market in 2001, she is looking past Cloe, Roxxi and Sasha this holiday season in favor of -- what else? -- an iPod.
But instead of giving up on the girls who turned Bratz into a blockbuster, the dolls' manufacturer is aggressively chasing after them, not with bigger and better Bratz characters, but digital video cameras and MP3 players. ''We don't look at ourselves as a toy company,'' said Isaac Larian, the chief executive of MGA Entertainment, the private company that owns Bratz. ''The toy market, to be frank, is just shrinking.''
