AFTER I graduated from Clark University, I worked as a paralegal on Madison Avenue. I got an apartment in Manhattan, on East 77th Street, between First and Second. It was a fourth-floor walk-up with no sink in the bathroom.
I enjoyed the concept of cable television. During college I had worked on the public-access television station in Worcester, Mass. I heard about a lecture series being taught at the New School. One week the guest speaker was Barbara Ruger, editor of Cablevision magazine. It was a trade magazine, a monthly that was going weekly, and they were looking for reporters. I went home and wrote an article about the lecture series, in the magazine's type font, and was hired for $11,000 a year.
