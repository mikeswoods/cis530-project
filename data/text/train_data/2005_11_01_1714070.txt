With an eye on a rapidly changing media environment, MTV Networks is expected to announce today that it has hired a prominent media strategist, Michael J. Wolf, a managing partner in the consulting firm of McKinsey & Company, as its president and chief operating officer.
Judy McGrath, the chairwoman of MTV Networks, will make the appointment official today, but in a telephone interview yesterday she called Mr. Wolf a star player in the media world with vast experience in devising business strategies for a wide range of media companies.
