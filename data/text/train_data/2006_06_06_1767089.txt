Brookfield Properties, one of the largest landlords in Manhattan, and the Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, said yesterday that they had agreed to acquire the Trizec real estate company for $4.8 billion.
Trizec Properties owns 61 properties with 40 million square feet of rental space in several major American cities. When the deal is completed, Brookfield will operate and manage some of Trizec's properties in New York and Los Angeles as well as all of its Houston and Washington buildings. Blackstone will run the other New York and Los Angeles buildings along with properties in San Diego.
