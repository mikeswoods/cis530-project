Barron's, the venerable financial magazine, has an unusual problem. People spend a long time reading it -- the average reader spends 2 hours and 12 minutes with it, to be exact. The problem is that a lot of prospective readers these days don't have 12 minutes, let alone 2 hours, to sit down with a magazine.
So Barron's is being redesigned to give readers a quicker way to see what's inside the magazine and let them re-enter later at their leisure. Edwin A. Finn Jr., Barron's editor and president, said that the new design, to appear May 16, was not caused by a sag in circulation, which has remained fairly steady at about 300,000. Rather, he said, Barron's wanted to keep readers by helping them navigate more quickly through the in-depth material.
