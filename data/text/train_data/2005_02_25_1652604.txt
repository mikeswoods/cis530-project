Defense lawyers for Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, called a former WorldCom board member yesterday to try to refute testimony by the prosecution's star witness, Scott D. Sullivan, that Mr. Ebbers knew about the fraudulent accounting practices that brought down the company.
Bert C. Roberts Jr., an outside board member at WorldCom until 2002, testified yesterday that Mr. Sullivan, WorldCom's former chief financial officer, told him that Mr. Ebbers knew nothing about journal entries that turned out to be fraudulent.
