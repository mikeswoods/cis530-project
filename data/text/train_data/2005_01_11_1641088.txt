Alltel, the nation's sixth-largest wireless carrier, announced formally yesterday that it had agreed to buy Western Wireless, a regional carrier in the Northwest, in a deal worth about $6 billion in cash, stock and debt.
The deal, which is expected to close by midyear, will create a company with about $10 billion in sales and 9.8 million subscribers, or about 6 percent of the cellphone market. Combined, the companies' networks will cover 55 percent of the United States by area and reach 25 percent of the population.
