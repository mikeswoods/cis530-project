ALL work had stopped at the cavernous Boeing assembly plant in Everett, Wash., just north of here. Five thousand rank-and-file workers and others stood idly, some eating airplane-shaped cookies, as they awaited the guest of honor, President Hu Jintao of China.
On a screen above their heads, images of Boeing planes painted in the colors of various Chinese airlines soared to uplifting music that swelled in the background. Then, a series of inspirational words flashed on the screen -- Exploration! Optimism! Brilliant! Vision! -- as Chinese pilots, speaking in Mandarin (with English subtitles), said how much they loved to fly Boeing planes.
