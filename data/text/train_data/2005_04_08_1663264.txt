The back-ordered Prius, with its hybrid gasoline-electric engine, is coming into the United States as fast as Toyota can turn the car out: 7,000 were shipped from Japan in February and the same number in January. That is just one of many indicators of how the everyday needs and desires of Americans keep imports rising despite a weaker dollar.
This winter, ships, planes and trucks coming from abroad also carried extra loads of costume jewelry from Austria and China; front-loading washing machines from Germany; tires from the Far East; refrigerators from Mexico and South Korea; and computers from China.
