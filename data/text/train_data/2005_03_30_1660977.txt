Individual taxpayers failed to pay up to $353 billion in taxes in 2001, according to a study released yesterday by the Internal Revenue Service.
The study examined the so-called tax gap, the difference between the amount of taxes owed by individual taxpayers and the amount collected. It was the agency's first large study on the issue since 1988.
