IF any of Rodney Eddins's accounting clients want his undivided attention at work first thing in the morning, they should shun e-mail or his telephone answering machine. Instead, they should send him a fax.
''The first thing I look at when I arrive is the incoming tray of my fax machine,'' said Mr. Eddins, a certified public accountant in Orlando, Fla., who has had his own practice for a decade. ''If there's paper there, I feel like I have to look at it.'' Only after he sorts through the morning's faxes -- though most on a recent day were ads like one for a workplace deodorizing service -- does Mr. Eddins log on to his computer and listen to his phone messages.
