The mobile phone giant Nokia reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings Thursday and was rewarded with a leap in its stock price, signaling that some investors believe that the company has turned a corner.
The company, which makes about a third of all the cellphones used in the world, reported net profit of 1.02 billion euros, or $1.33 billion, for the quarter, a 12.7 percent drop from a year ago, but up from 660 million euros in the third quarter. For the full year, the company, which is based in Espoo, Finland, made 3.21 billion euros, down from 3.59 billion euros in 2003.
