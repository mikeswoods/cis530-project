Heart patients face significant complication rates from the surgical replacement of implanted defibrillators, a finding that should temper decisions by doctors about whether to prematurely remove a recalled device in some patients, according to a study published yesterday in a major medical journal.
A separate report in the same publication, The Journal of the American Medical Association, found that while the malfunction rates of pacemakers decreased over the last decade, a similar rate in defibrillators increased fourfold in 2002 from 1998.
