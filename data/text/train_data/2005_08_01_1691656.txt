At the height of Watergate, five people at The Washington Post were subpoenaed, including the reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who were ordered to turn over their notes. In an attempt to stymie prosecutors, The Post transferred some of those notes to Katharine Graham, the paper's publisher, who also had been subpoenaed.
Mrs. Graham later wrote in her memoir that Benjamin C. Bradlee, the paper's executive editor, had said of the maneuver: ''And if the judge wants to send anyone to jail, he's going to have to send Mrs. Graham. And, my God, the lady says she'll go! Then the judge can have that on his conscience.''
