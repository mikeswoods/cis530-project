Samuel Israel III, the founder and chief executive of the Bayou Group, the Connecticut hedge fund that seemingly disappeared overnight in what federal prosecutors have described as a $300 million fraud, is expected to surrender to federal authorities today, a law enforcement official who has been briefed on the case said last night.
The fund's chief financial officer, Daniel E. Marino, also is expected to surrender.
