The oil industry has agreed to contribute $2 billion to help clean up spills of a gasoline additive that is fouling groundwater in exchange for immunity protection against dozens of lawsuits, people close to the negotiations said.
But the industry's proposed contribution, which would go into a new fund set up to deal with claims of contamination by the fuel additive, methyl tertiary-butyl ether, or MTBE, falls far short of some estimates of what it would take to pay for the cleanups.
