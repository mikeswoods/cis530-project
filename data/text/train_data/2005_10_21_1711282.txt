A well-known advertising executive and worldwide creative director at WPP Group resigned his position yesterday amid an uproar over remarks he made at an industry event about female creative executives. The comments, by Neil French, 61, drew attention to the absence of women at the highest levels of the creative side of the ad industry.
Mr. French told an audience in Toronto on Oct. 6 that women ''don't make it to the top because they don't deserve to,'' saying their roles as caregivers and childbearers prevented them from succeeding in top positions.
