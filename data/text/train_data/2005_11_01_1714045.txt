Telefónica of Spain agreed Monday to buy the British mobile phone company O2  for $31.5 billion in a deal that could spur greater competition in Europe's more established markets.
''My view is that Telefónica is in aggressive acquisition mode,'' said Satyajit Chatterjee, a credit analyst with Société Générale in London, referring to the price offered for O2.
