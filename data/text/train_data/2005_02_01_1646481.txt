BREAD, long under attack, is finally striking back.
The goal of a campaign that begins today in two East Coast markets and online (grainpower.org) is to counteract the onslaughts against bread from diet books and regimens that denigrate carbohydrates. The campaign is sponsored by a new organization, the Grain Foods Foundation, with 90 members that include marketers from the baking and milling industries like Cargill, ConAgra, Flowers Industries, General Mills, Interstate Bakeries and Sara Lee, along with trade associations and suppliers.
