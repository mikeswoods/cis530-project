The Charles Dolan family withdrew its bid yesterday to take the Cablevision Systems Corporation private, after negotiating since June, and asked directors to approve a $3 billion dividend to shareholders.
The family, which controls 71 percent of the vote and 22 percent of the equity in Cablevision, issued a terse statement yesterday saying that it ''has become clear that we will be unable to reach an agreement'' with directors.
