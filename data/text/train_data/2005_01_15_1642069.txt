The Boeing Company said yesterday that it would take a $615 million pretax write-off as it ends production of the 717, its smallest commercial jet, and faces delays in a $23 billion Air Force aerial tanker program.
Boeing, which is based in Chicago, said the write-off, which comes to 48 cents a share, would be reflected in its fourth-quarter and year-end 2004 earnings, scheduled to be released Feb. 2. Losses related to the tanker program came to $275 million, the amount of money the company has spent on its Air Force bid, while Boeing expects that ceasing production of the 717 will result in a loss of $340 million.
