Carl C. Icahn is relishing his new reputation as a friend of shareholders.
''I haven't changed my beliefs about the mediocrity of many corporate managers,'' said Mr. Icahn, 69, who made his name in the 1980's going after the chief executives of companies like Texaco and Marshall Field. ''What's changed is the perception. Now, instead of being called a corporate raider, I'm an activist.''
