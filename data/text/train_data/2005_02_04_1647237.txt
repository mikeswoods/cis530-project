In an unusual move, Nortel Networks, the telecommunications equipment maker, has filed a lawsuit against a former chief executive and two other officers who were fired last year, seeking to recover bonuses totaling 12.9 million Canadian dollars, or $10.4 million.
Last month, an internal investigation at Nortel found that the former chief executive, Frank A. Dunn; a chief financial officer, Douglas C. Beatty; and a former corporate controller, Michael J. Gollogly; manipulated financial statements to win bonus payments. All three men were dismissed last April.
