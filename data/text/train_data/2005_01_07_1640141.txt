In case you've forgotten, Saturn's memorable first wave of commercials in 1990 promised a different kind of company. The ads showed autoworkers brimming with sunny optimism at Saturn's newfangled factory in Tennessee, a world away from Detroit.
Saturn was a pet project of General Motors' chairman and chief executive of the 1980's, Roger B. Smith. It promised a different kind of car with a plastic, dent-resistant body, built with the latest manufacturing techniques and sold without haggling. It was just the kind of out-of-the-box idea that was going to win back hundreds of thousands of car buyers flocking to Toyota and Honda.
