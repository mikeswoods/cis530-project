The Dana Corporation, the auto parts maker, said Wednesday that it missed two payments totaling $21 million that were due on its bonds, heightening speculation that it might be forced to seek bankruptcy protection.
Dana said it would take advantage of a 30-day grace period for making the interest payments, which were due on two categories of senior notes.
