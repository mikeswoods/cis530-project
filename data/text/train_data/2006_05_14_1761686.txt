I'M from the Engadine Valley of Switzerland. My first language is Rhaeto-Romansh, a Latin-based gypsy mishmash that's one of Switzerland's four official languages besides German, French and Italian. It's totally useless, but it's the key to other Latin-based languages. I speak eight other languages.
My father believed in discipline and sent me to boarding school at St-Gingolph, in France, opposite Ã‰vian. It was like a boot camp. I would look across the lake and see the lights of Lausanne. I wished to go far away and see Hong Kong, Sydney, New York. I was 14 or 15.
