Luxtera, a small start-up based on technology pioneered at the California Institute of Technology, plans to announce today a new class of silicon chips that blur the line between electronic computing and optical communications.
The chips, which contain both traditional electronic circuits and ultrathin conduits for laser light, herald the potential to blend the low-cost manufacturing prowess of the semiconductor world with the ultrahigh-speed potential of laser optical networking.
