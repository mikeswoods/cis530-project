Scientists at I.B.M. and two partner companies have developed a promising material that they believe will lead to a new kind of computer memory chip able to meet the growing appetite for storing digital music, pictures and video.
The advance will be described in a technical paper to be presented Monday at the International Electron Devices Meeting in San Francisco by researchers from I.B.M. and two computer memory manufacturers, Qimonda and Macronix. The scientists have designed a new semiconductor alloy derived from materials currently used in optical storage devices like CDs and DVDs.
