The Eastman Kodak Company, which has struggled to make its name as synonymous with digital photography as it is with film, named Antonio M. Perez its next chief executive yesterday. Mr. Perez, who had been Kodak's president and chief operating officer, will take over on June 1.
The current chief executive, Daniel A. Carp, will remain as chairman until the end of the year, when Mr. Perez will assume that role as well. The chief operating officer's position will remain vacant.
