Federal prosecutors announced Thursday that a second big maker of computer memory chips, Hynix Semiconductor of South Korea, had agreed to plead guilty to participating in a global conspiracy to fix prices and would pay a $185 million fine, the largest criminal penalty assessed during the Bush administration.
The Justice Department announced the inquiry last September and disclosed that Infineon Technologies, a German chip maker, had agreed to pay a $160 million fine in the case. Shortly after that announcement, four Infineon executives pleaded guilty to conspiracy to fix prices and were each sentenced to penalties of $250,000 and prison terms of four to six months.
