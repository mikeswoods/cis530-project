I HURTLED toward the restricted military airspace over Avon Park Air Force Range in the rear cockpit of a TF-51 Mustang named Crazy Horse, clutching the control stick. The World War II vintage instruments indicated the plane was going 300 miles an hour at an altitude of 7,500 feet, some 40 miles south of Kissimmee, Fla.
It seemed, however, that I was in a slow-motion dream, sailing on a pale blue ocean frothing with cumulus cloud waves. Next to witnessing my wife give birth to our son, flying the Mustang was by far the coolest, most humbling thing I'd ever done. It made me feel bolder than Batman, cockier than a barnyard rooster. At the same time, it also scared me silly.
