TAX systems are like septic tanks: they need to be cleaned out every 10 years or so.
The last significant structural tax reform in the United States was in 1986, so we are long overdue for a thorough cleansing.

But since then, virtually every piece of tax legislation introduced in Congress has added to the complexity and inefficiency of the tax system.
