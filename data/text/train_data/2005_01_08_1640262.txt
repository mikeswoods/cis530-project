The United States said yesterday that it planned to appeal a ruling by the World Trade Organization that the country is violating its international trade obligations by prohibiting residents from gambling over the Internet.
The notice of appeal, filed in Geneva by the United States trade representative, asserts that the country's position on Internet gambling is consistent with its longstanding trade agreements. The trade representative plans to file the substance of the appeal next week with the W.T.O.
