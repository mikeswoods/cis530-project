Krispy Kreme, the doughnut maker, announced the departure of six top executives yesterday, as the struggling company looks to clean up its operations and turn itself around.
In a terse news release, the company said a special committee of independent board directors decided last week that six company officers should be discharged. The departing executives, who were not identified, held leading positions in the company's operations, finance, business development, and manufacturing and distribution divisions.
