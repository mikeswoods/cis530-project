EVER since Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company's hostile takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1989, leveraged-buyout shops have disavowed pursuing hostile deals and worked to remake their image as friends of management while renaming themselves ''private equity firms'' -- which sounds so much more civilized.
Henry R. Kravis, the original barbarian at the gate (to borrow the memorable phrase that Bryan Burrough and John Helyar used to describe the men behind that landmark hostile takeover), has gone to great lengths to appear as a friend of corporate America over the past decade and a half, publicly declaring that his firm won't pursue hostile deals anymore.
