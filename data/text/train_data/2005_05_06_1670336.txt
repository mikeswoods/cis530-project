The relentless rise in health care costs is causing states and businesses to fight over whose job it is to insure workers. And nearly two dozen states, struggling with the growing burden of providing public assistance to people with jobs but no insurance, are looking to shift more of the financial burden onto the workers' employers.
Last month, for example, Maryland, which spends roughly $350 million a year on health care for the uninsured, passed a bill requiring the state's very largest employers to spend at least 8 percent of their payrolls on health benefits for their workers. Lawmakers elsewhere, including Connecticut, are considering legislation that may also require some companies to provide coverage, either directly or by paying into a state fund.
