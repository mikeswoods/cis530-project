The Delaware Supreme Court upheld on Thursday a lower court decision exonerating the Walt Disney Company's board and two former executives of charges in a shareholder lawsuit that they neglected their duties and wasted company assets.
At issue was the hiring of Michael S. Ovitz as the company's president in 1995 and his ouster 14 months later with a $130 million severance package, both engineered by Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chief executive. Mr. Eisner left the company last year.
