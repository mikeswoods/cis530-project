EBay, the online marketplace, reported yesterday that its net income rose 40 percent in the third quarter and that revenue reached $1.11 billion, driven largely by growth in the United States and German markets.
But the company reduced its earnings guidance slightly for the full year because of its recent $2.6 billion acquisition of Skype Technologies, while still increasing its revenue forecast. As a result, eBay shares fell nearly 6 percent in after-hours trading, after gaining $1.59, to $42.01, before the report was released.
