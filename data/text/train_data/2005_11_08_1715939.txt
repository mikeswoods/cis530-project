Microsoft released an updated version of its database program for large corporations yesterday, the first of a series of major updates to its core technologies that it plans to introduce in the next year.
The new version of SQL Server, the first major one in nearly five years, is intended to improve Microsoft's ability to compete with Oracle, the leading seller of corporate database software.
