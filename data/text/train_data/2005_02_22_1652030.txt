May Department Stores, which owns Lord & Taylor and Marshall Field's, has suspended its search for a chief executive as merger talks with Federated Department Stores advanced over the weekend, executives close to the company said yesterday.
May's decision to halt the search process is the most significant indication yet that it is seriously considering a takeover bid from Federated, the nation's largest department store company, with chains like Macy's and Bloomingdale's. May instructed the executive recruitment firm it had hired, Spencer Stuart, to ''put the search on the back burner'' while it negotiates with Federated, one executive said. May had hired Spencer Stuart a month ago when its chairman and chief executive, Gene S. Kahn, was ousted. His resignation led Federated to approach May.
