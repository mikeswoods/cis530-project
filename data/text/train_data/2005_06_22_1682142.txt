A federal appeals court said yesterday that the Securities and Exchange Commission must produce a cost-benefit analysis to justify a rule that boards of mutual funds must have an independent chairman and at least 75 percent of directors who are independent.
The ruling, by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on a lawsuit filed by the United States Chamber of Commerce, is significant because it comes at a time that the commission is in transition. The S.E.C. chairman, William H. Donaldson, is resigning at the end of the month; President Bush has named Representative Christopher Cox, a conservative Republican from California, to be Mr. Donaldson's successor. The rule on mutual fund boards was adopted in June 2004 by a vote of 3 to 2, with Mr. Donaldson voting with the two Democratic commissioners.
