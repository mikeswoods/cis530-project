Dr. Zvi Y. Fuks, the Manhattan cancer doctor who was arrested yesterday on securities fraud charges stemming from sales of ImClone Systems stock, was the matchmaker who helped make ImClone successful. He arranged a meeting that led to ImClone's licensing of the cancer drug Erbitux, its first and so far only product.
Dr. Fuks, 68, is chairman of the department of radiation oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. Specialists in the field described him as a brilliant and charismatic leader who won top awards for research on how radiation kills cancer cells and who helped elevate Memorial Sloan-Kettering's radiation oncology department into one of the strongest in the country.
