Fidelity Investments, the giant mutual fund company, said yesterday that federal regulators were considering taking civil action against it as part of an inquiry over whether its employees improperly accepted gifts or entertainment from brokers.
Fidelity, which manages more than $1 trillion, said it had received a Wells notice from the Boston office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, meaning that the agency's staff is preparing to recommend action against the company and is giving Fidelity a chance to refute any accusations.
