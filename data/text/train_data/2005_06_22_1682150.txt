The Chinese oil and gas giant CNOOC was expected to decide at a Wednesday board meeting whether to make a cash bid of around $18 billion for Unocal, according to one executive involved in the negotiations.
If the state-controlled CNOOC does make a bid, it would be pitting itself directly against Chevron, which signed a $16.4 billion cash and stock agreement to buy Unocal in April.
