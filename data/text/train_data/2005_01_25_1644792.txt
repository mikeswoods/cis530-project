Anthony Elgindy, a well-known figure in the Internet world of penny stocks, was convicted yesterday on charges that he used confidential information from an F.B.I. agent about criminal investigations to profit illegally in the market.
The former agent who supplied the information, Jeffrey A. Royer, was also found guilty of securities fraud conspiracy charges related to Mr. Elgindy's stock-selling scheme. The federal grand jury in Brooklyn had deliberated for four days after a 10-week trial.
