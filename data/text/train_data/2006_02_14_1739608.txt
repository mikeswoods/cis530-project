The World Trade Organization ruled yesterday that tax breaks the United States gives to some of its largest companies are illegal and the European Union said it would impose new trade sanctions in three months unless the tax breaks were abolished.
The ruling is the second in four years involving tax breaks that the United States granted to 6,000 exporters, including Boeing, Microsoft and General Electric, initially under the Foreign Sales Corporation program and subsequently under the American Jobs Creation Act.
