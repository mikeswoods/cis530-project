A former broker with the Bank of America Corporation was acquitted yesterday of 29 counts tied to improper trading in mutual funds, the first major legal defeat for the New York State attorney general, Eliot Spitzer. A mistrial was declared on four remaining counts.
The former broker, Theodore C. Sihpol III, 37, had been accused of enabling a hedge fund manager, Edward J. Stern, to make improper trades in mutual funds. It was a tip about trading by Mr. Stern's hedge fund in 2003 that initiated a sweeping investigation of the mutual fund industry by Mr. Spitzer's office, joined by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators.
