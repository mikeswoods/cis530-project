UBS, Europe's largest bank, posted a 12 percent jump in quarterly net profit Tuesday, helped by rebounding global financial markets after the American presidential elections, and solid returns in its private wealth business.
UBS reported a net profit of 2.02 billion Swiss francs ($1.65 billion) in the fourth quarter. For the full year, net income rose 29 percent, to 8.09 billion francs, a record. The results showed that UBS, traditionally strong in managing private wealth, has gathered momentum in expanding its investment banking business to compete with the Wall Street giants that dominate securities trading and advisory work, analysts said.
