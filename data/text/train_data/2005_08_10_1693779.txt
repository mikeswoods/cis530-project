Merrill Lynch & Company agreed last week to pay $37 million to settle a claim that it had been shortchanging people for years. But the plaintiffs were not the firm's customers. They were its own stockbrokers.
Merrill has treated its brokers, who earn the bulk of their income from sales commissions, as if they were exempt from state and federal laws on overtime pay. But a suit filed last year on behalf of the firm's brokers in California argued that the brokers should be paid overtime when they work more than 8 hours in a day or 40 in a week.
