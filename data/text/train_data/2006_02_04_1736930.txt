Bill Powell, a sports photographer in Tulsa, Okla., shoots high school and college games and sells his work to the players and their parents.
He prints on a Canon Pixma photo printer, but he does not use Canon ink. For the last eight months he has been buying refilled cartridges from Cartridge World. ''I couldn't tell the difference, and my customers couldn't tell the difference,'' Mr. Powell said. ''It saves me about 50 percent.''
