Valley County, not far from the center of Nebraska, seemed to be one of those Great Plains communities that was dying. From World War II to 2000 it had lost almost half its population, and the decline was gathering speed at the end of the century. The I.G.A. and Jack & Jill grocery stores closed, as did most mom and pop gas stations and the local dairy processing plant.
In the last five years, though, something utterly unexpected has happened. The decline has stopped. More people are moving to Ord, the county seat, than leaving, and the county's population is likely to show its first increase this decade since the 1920's.
