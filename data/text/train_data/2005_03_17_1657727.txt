Toys ''R'' Us, once the most powerful toy seller in the country, will be sold to a team of two private equity firms and a real estate developer-- Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Bain Capital Partners, along with Vornado Realty Trust -- for about $6 billion, people involved in the negotiations said last night.
The deal is for the company's faster-growing baby supplies division, Babies ''R'' Us, as well as the 640 Toys ''R'' Us stores. But in the end, the sale, which is expected to be announced today, may be as much about real estate as toys.
