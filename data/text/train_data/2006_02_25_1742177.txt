MAGAZINES like Maxim may be sophomoric but at least they add a dash of self-irony that makes their puerility a bit easier to swallow. Office Pirates, the Webzine introduced this week by Time Warner and run by a former editor of Maxim, is an online version of that guy in your office who makes a lot of bad jokes and doesn't let the fact that nobody is laughing slow him down.
Indeed, even though in its videos, jokes and blog entries the site officepirates.com takes on many stock office characters (the clueless boss, the busybody, the put-upon schlep), when it comes to the most offensive -- the obnoxious, overgrown frat boy -- it is either silent or vaguely approving.
