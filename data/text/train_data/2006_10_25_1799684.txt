One of Hollywood's top five talent agencies has created an online unit devoted to scouting out up-and-coming creators of Internet content -- particularly video -- and finding work for them in Web-based advertising and entertainment, as well as in the older media.
The move by the United Talent Agency -- best known as the home of comedians like Vince Vaughn and Jack Black, filmmakers like M. Night Shyamalan and television producers like Dick Wolf and David Chase -- amounts to a bet, albeit a modest one, that Web video is on a growth curve similar to that of cable television a generation ago. It is also a return by Hollywood's core talent representatives to the sort of new-media business they tested, without great success, at the peak of the dot-com boom.
