Mary Ann Davies has spent more than $100,000 in the last year to send her 16-year-old daughter to one private counseling and educational program after another. She has just signed up to go further into debt, committing herself to spend another $100,000 over the next two years for a boarding school in New York that she hopes will help her daughter overcome a drug problem.
''We're saving this life,'' said Ms. Davies, who works in advertising in Richmond, Va. ''You can't put a price on that.''
