Do you cover the B string for a C major chord? A new electric guitar lets you know with a glance at the fret board, where a display of light-emitting diodes shows you where to place your fingers.
The $599 Fretlight FG-400 has 132 computer-controlled L.E.D.'s embedded in its fret board that display 3,000 chord variants, 500 arpeggios, notes and custom chords.
