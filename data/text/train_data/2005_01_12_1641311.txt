The prosecution's closing argument yesterday in the securities fraud trial of Anthony Elgindy and Jeffrey A. Royer focused on the questions posed at the start: Were Mr. Elgindy, a controversial Internet stock guru, and Mr. Royer, a former F.B.I. agent, crime-fighting crusaders for integrity in the marketplace? Or were they crusaders for personal gain?
Seth Levine, an assistant United States attorney, left little doubt about where the government stood. ''There was no crusade here,'' Mr. Levine told the jury. ''They were not crime-fighting heroes. They weren't called on the Batphone because the commissioner couldn't handle the crime. They were mercenaries.''
