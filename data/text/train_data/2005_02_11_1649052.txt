After decades of being a diversified conglomerate, the Sara Lee Corporation has concluded that hot dogs and underwear do not belong under the same roof.
In a broad reorganization, Sara Lee named a new chief executive and announced plans to divest four businesses that together account for 40 percent of the company's revenue. C. Steven McMillan, who also announced that he was stepping down as chief executive, said Sara Lee would spin off its $4.5 billion apparel business, its $1.1 billion European packaged meat division, American coffee brands like Hills Bros. and Chock full o' Nuts, and a direct-sales unit for cosmetics and household products.
