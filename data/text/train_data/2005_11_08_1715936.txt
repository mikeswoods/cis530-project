Independence Air, a low-fare airline that struggled with high fuel prices and stiff competition, filed for bankruptcy protection Monday and said that it would try to sell itself, in whole or in parts, within 60 days to avoid running out of cash.
The potential disappearance of Independence and its parent company, FLYi Inc., based at Washington Dulles International Airport, comes at a time when there are too many flights chasing too few passengers in some markets.
