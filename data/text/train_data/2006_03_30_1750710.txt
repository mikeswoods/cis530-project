It had been nearly 15 years since Henri Elfassy boogied the night away at a discoth√®que, but for the last few months, that's exactly what he's been doing. Not for fun, mind you, but for work.
Mr. Elfassy, 55, is the owner of a high-end salon on Madison Avenue, which until October was known as Salon a Deux. He has an extensive list of loyal, well-heeled followers -- among them, the jewelry designer Judith Ripka-Berk and the actress Candice Bergen. But last spring, Mr. Elfassy began thinking that it was time to bring a fresh face to his business, someone who could connect with a younger, hip crowd but still maintain the quality that his regular customers were used to.
