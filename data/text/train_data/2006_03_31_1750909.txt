In a surprise move, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Houston late yesterday ordered that a former Merrill Lynch executive, William Fuhs, be immediately released on bail awaiting final decision on his appeal.
Mr. Fuhs was one of four former Merrill employees convicted in 2004 on fraud and conspiracy charges involving a 1999 sale by Enron of power generators mounted on barges in Nigeria. Prosecutors argued during the trial that the Merrill executives were guilty of conspiring to defraud investors in an effort to win future banking business from Enron.
