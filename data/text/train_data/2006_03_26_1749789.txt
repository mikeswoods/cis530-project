I WAS at Virginia Tech and was thinking about being an engineer, but then I decided I didn't like engineering and switched to pre-med. I applied to the University of Michigan for sentimental reasons. I was born in Ann Arbor, still had a lot of relatives there, and the program had a good reputation. I was accepted.
I remember liking gross anatomy and embryology my first year, but in the second year pharmacology was like memorizing the white pages of the phone book.
