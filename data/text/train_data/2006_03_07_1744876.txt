DaimlerChrysler has dismissed or suspended several employees after an internal investigation uncovered evidence that its executives paid bribes in Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe.
In a report filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it had ''determined that improper payments were made in a number of jurisdictions.'' The payments, it said, could violate both German law and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States.
