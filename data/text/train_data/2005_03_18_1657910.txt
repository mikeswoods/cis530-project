IN the annals of Wall Street disasters, a special place of dishonor should be reserved for the bosses of good companies who were so gullible or foolish that they agreed to exchange their company's stock for shares in a company whose value was inflated by fraud or fad.
There were several memorable deals in the recent bubble. Time Warner agreed to surrender most of its stock to owners of America Online, which was riding high, and became AOL Time Warner. MCI, a solid company in a declining business, sold out for shares in WorldCom, which had been put together by Bernard J. Ebbers, a man who now tells us that he never knew much of anything about either finance or communications technology.
