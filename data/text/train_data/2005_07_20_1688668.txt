Hewlett-Packard announced Tuesday that it will lay off 14,500 workers, or nearly 10 percent of its staff, over the next 18 months as part of a revamping plan that the company's executives hope will turn around the struggling fortunes of the giant computer and printer maker.
The cuts come four months into the tenure of Mark V. Hurd, who took over as chief executive on April 1. Mr. Hurd was named to lead the company after the board dismissed Carleton S. Fiorina for failing to carry out an ambitious corporate strategy to compete with the likes of I.B.M. and Dell.
