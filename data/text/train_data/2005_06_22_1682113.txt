The European military contractor EADS has selected Mobile, Ala., over sites in three other Southern states as the location for its engineering and manufacturing plant as it tries to compete for a deal to supply aerial refueling tankers to the United States Air Force.
EADS North America, a unit of the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, is expected to announce today that it has selected a site at the Mobile airport, people involved in the negotiations said yesterday. Alabama, one of four finalists, was picked over Florida, Mississippi and South Carolina.
