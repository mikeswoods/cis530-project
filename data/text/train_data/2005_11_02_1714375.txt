A judge in Arkansas yesterday tossed out part of Wal-Mart's lawsuit against its former vice chairman, Thomas M. Coughlin, citing an agreement that bars the former executive and the company from suing each other. Mr. Coughlin has been accused by Wal-Mart of misusing up to $500,000 of company money.
Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest retailer, sued to prevent Mr. Coughlin from collecting about $12 million worth of retirement benefits. It has accused Mr. Coughlin, who had effectively been the No. 2 executive, of dipping into company funds to pay for everything from beer to a customized dog kennel.
