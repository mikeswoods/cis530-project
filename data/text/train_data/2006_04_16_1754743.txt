I COME from a family of eight children. I have six sisters and a much younger brother. I was the third-oldest. The town had a population of about 2,000 people.
Having grown up in a small town, I now see that the approach is a lot different from in a city. Everybody knew everybody, and you didn't do anything you didn't want everybody to know about. When I was 5 or 6, my friends and I were playing with matches. Within an hour, my mother knew about it.
