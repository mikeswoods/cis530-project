Three years after declaring the biggest sovereign debt default in history, Argentina will begin a global roadshow today, hoping to persuade wary investors to accept a write-down on about $100 billion of holdings. Many analysts and lending officials say that Argentina may succeed.
The campaign will start at the Economy Ministry in Buenos Aires, where Roberto Lavagna, the minister of economy and production, will outline the remaining details of what the Argentine government insists is its final offer to repay part of the defaulted debt. From there, officials will travel to the United States and Europe to push for the proposal with foreign bondholders, many of whom have already criticized the idea in outline form.
