WE are driving slowly under a long canopy formed by the shiny tails of Boeing 747's parked in the Sonoran Desert 20 miles west of Tucson. Beyond a vast expanse of desert and cactuses, mountain peaks rim the horizon. It's warm. More important, it's dry.
Looming around us is an amazing sight for any seasoned business traveler: row after row of silent, abandoned airliners, great jets that once soared over the earth. More than 300 are parked here. Some are going to be worked over and eventually resold to airlines around the world. Others are waiting for the banks or domestic airlines to reclaim them, and who knows when or if. Many are waiting for mechanics to strip away useable parts before wreckers tear apart the fuselages for aluminum.
