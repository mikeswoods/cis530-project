The Capital One Financial Corporation, one of the nation's biggest credit card companies, said yesterday that it would buy the Hibernia Corporation, a regional banking company based in New Orleans, for $5.35 billion.
Capital One, which is based in McLean, Va., has repeatedly told Wall Street that owning a retail bank would help it lower its cost of borrowing, increase deposits and compete more vigorously in the credit card business.
