The Navy Yard, a huge commercial redevelopment area here along the waterfront where two rivers -- the Delaware and the Schuylkill -- converge, fits somewhere between the paradigms of a dense downtown and a sterile suburban office park.
Owned and operated by the Navy for more than 200 years, the 1,000 acres of underused space were taken over by the city in 2000 after the Navy consolidated its uses to the western edge of what used to be called League Island.
