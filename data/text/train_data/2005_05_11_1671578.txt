Cisco Systems, the largest maker of equipment for directing traffic on the Internet, reported Tuesday that third-quarter profits rose 16 percent, spurred by increased demand from telecommunications companies upgrading their networks.
The company, which is considered a bellwether in the corporate technology industry, had net income of $1.41 billion, or 21 cents a share, compared with net income of $1.21 billion, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier.
