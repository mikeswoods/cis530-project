Battered by brutal fare competition and ever-higher oil prices, major airlines have found a valuable antidote: carrying passengers overseas. International flights are in record demand as the summer travel season kicks off, and ticket prices, always high at this time of year, seem extra pricey compared with low fares at home.
The biggest push is to Europe, as American passengers jump on the euro's recent weakening. But getting there will not be cheap for procrastinators. Consumers who waited until now to book their international tickets can expect to pay a minimum of $1,000 from New York to popular destinations like London and Paris.
