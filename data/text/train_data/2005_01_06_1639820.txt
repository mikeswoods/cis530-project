CNN has ended its relationship with the conservative commentator Tucker Carlson and will shortly cancel its long-running daily political discussion program, ''Crossfire,'' the new president of CNN, Jonathan Klein, said last night.
Mr. Carlson said he had actually quit ''Crossfire'' last April and had agreed to stay on until his contract expired. He said he had a deal in place for a job as the host of a 9 p.m. nightly talk program on MSNBC, CNN's rival.
