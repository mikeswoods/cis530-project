I GREW up in Miami, with a complicated, tortured and volatile father and a mother who tried everything to make a bad marriage work. My father abandoned the family in 1982, but I'm still sure that growing up with him was the reason I wound up in the arts.
When my dad married my mom, he was 23 and she was 18, and they had my older brother, David, just one year later. My dad felt trapped by the parental and fiscal responsibilities. He found his peace through drinking and Valium and beating David, sometimes severely.
