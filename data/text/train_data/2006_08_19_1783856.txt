The Ford Motor Company, which is struggling to keep its grip on second place in the American car market, said Friday that it would cut by one-fifth the number of vehicles it plans to build in the final three months of the year.
The slowdown represented the deepest production cuts since the industry's crisis of the 1980's. It also underscored the difficulty that Detroit, whose business relies on sales of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, is having as gas prices remain around $3 a gallon. Detroit's market share has dropped to its lowest level in history, while Asian brands, known for their fuel efficiency, are setting sales records.
