Two top executives at American International Group, the insurance company, were dismissed yesterday for refusing to cooperate with regulators in a widening investigation of the accounting for some insurance transactions.
The two executives -- Howard Smith, the chief financial officer, and Christian Milton, the vice president for reinsurance -- were both dismissed yesterday after invoking their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination in dealing with regulators investigating a transaction between A.I.G. and General Re, a reinsurance unit owned by Berkshire Hathaway, people close to the investigation said last night.
