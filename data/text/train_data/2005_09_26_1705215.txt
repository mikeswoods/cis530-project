Hollinger International's prominent independent directors, including Richard N. Perle, Henry A. Kissinger and James R. Thompson, remain in their paid positions more than a year after several were censured for their conduct in an internal company report.
A number of the directors were sharply criticized, and two, including Mr. Perle, are even being sued by the newspaper company. Several directors, including Mr. Thompson and Mr. Kissinger, are among a group of current and past board members who agreed in May to pay $50 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit contending that they failed to perform their duties.
