Reflecting the struggling state of North American automakers, the Canadian Auto Workers reached a tentative agreement with DaimlerChrysler Canada early Tuesday that eliminates about 1,600 jobs and offers only limited wage and benefit gains.
The Canadian arm of the Chrysler Group avoided a strike scheduled to start Tuesday night by abandoning a plan to contract out several services, including trucking, as well as closing a casting plant in Toronto. Those moves, the union said, would have eliminated 2,500 jobs.
