Air France-KLM, Europe's biggest airline, said Thursday that it had begun talks that could eventually lead to the takeover of Alitalia, the Italian carrier.
Alitalia, which is half-owned by the Italian government, is actively looking for a partner. But analysts see any deal as uncertain as long as the company continues to lose money. The stock of both companies fell in Europe.
