Google said in a surprise move on Thursday that it would raise a $4 billion war chest with a new stock offering. The announcement stirred widespread speculation in Silicon Valley that Google, the premier online search site, would move aggressively into businesses well beyond Web searching and search-based advertising.
Google, which raised $1.67 billion in its initial public offering last August, expects to collect $4.04 billion by selling 14,159,265 million Class A shares, based on Wednesday's closing price of $285.10. In Google's whimsical fashion, the number of shares offered is the same as the first eight digits after the decimal point in pi, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, which starts with 3.14159265.
