Neal Shapiro, the president of NBC News since 2001, has told his superiors at the network in recent days that he would like to leave his post, two senior executives at NBC Universal said yesterday.
Though the request was characterized as coming at Mr. Shapiro's initiative, it comes just weeks after Jeff Zucker, president of the NBC Universal Television Group, helped engineer the dismissal of Tom Touchet, the executive producer of the ''Today'' show, in response to that program's rapidly falling ratings lead over its principal rival, ''Good Morning America'' on ABC.
