After seven weeks of testimony and often heated legal wrangling, a jury of six women and three men began deliberations here on Tuesday in Humeston v. Merck, the second Vioxx-related lawsuit to go to trial.
The jury received the case after a two-hour closing argument from the plaintiff's lawyer, Christopher Seeger, who urged jurors to hold Merck accountable for hiding information about Vioxx's heart risks from doctors.
