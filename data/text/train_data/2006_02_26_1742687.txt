With roots reaching back to 1919 in Shanghai, the American International Group seems a fitting global sponsor of the Asia Society's 50th anniversary season, celebrated at a dinner in New York last week. The first Western company allowed to sell life insurance on its own in China, A.I.G. faces potential competition from its former chairman and chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, who is exploring various investments there, including some in the insurance industry. Asked at the dinner if this concerned him, Martin J. Sullivan, A.I.G.'s president and chief executive and Mr. Greenberg's successor, said: ''I'm just focused on running our business. I remain very upbeat about Asia.''
E. Neville Isdell, chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, another sponsor of the anniversary season, said that in Japan, his company's most innovative and profitable market, ''We're leaders in ready-to-drink tea and coffee and sports drinks, and we vend and sell hot coffee as well.'' He added: ''I think we can take those technologies we have there and bring them in here and develop them in exactly the same way. The U.S. market has developed global tastes.''
