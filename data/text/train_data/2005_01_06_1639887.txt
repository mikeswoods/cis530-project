Havas appears to be in jeopardy of losing its third-largest client, the Intel Corporation, which has signaled that it is considering eliminating agencies owned by Havas from a review for worldwide advertising assignments that began in October, advertising executives who were told of its plans said.
If Intel dismissed the Havas agencies, as Adweek.com reported on Tuesday that it planned to do, they would lose assignments, with spending estimated at more than $300 million, that they have handled for several years.
