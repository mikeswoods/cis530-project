The United States Supreme Court on Monday rejected a bid by Research in Motion, the Canadian maker of BlackBerry e-mail devices, to review its patent dispute with the holding company NTP.
The court's decision means that the case is now back in the hands of Judge James R. Spencer of Federal District Court in Richmond, Va. He is considering a request from NTP to impose an injunction banning the sale and use of most BlackBerry hand-held devices in the United States.
