UBS, Europe's largest bank, reported a 71 percent increase in third-quarter profit Tuesday, benefiting from a boom in oil-related wealth in the Middle East and Asia.
UBS said it earned 2.77 billion Swiss francs ($2.15 billion) in the period, up from 1.62 billion francs a year earlier, as its wealth management unit increased the size of its asset portfolio by 31.1 billion francs.
