The European Commission said Friday that it had accused MasterCard of conducting restrictive business practices in the European credit and debit card market.
If the commission rules against MasterCard, the company could be forced to end a transaction charge known as a cross-border interchange fee. The company would not be fined because it notified the commission about the fees long before antitrust officials started their investigation, Jonathan Todd, a commission competition spokesman, said Friday.
