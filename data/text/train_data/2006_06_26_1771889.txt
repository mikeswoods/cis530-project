Portuguese soccer fans are 14.67 times as confident as the rest of the world that Portugal will win the World Cup, according to a study performed by comScore Networks, an Internet consumer-research firm. By contrast, Germany's self-appraisal is only 3.73 times as high as the conventional wisdom.
The figures come from a study by comScore that derived ''overconfidence indexes'' for six European countries and the United States. ComScore polled 5,000 people about their national teams' chances of winning the World Cup. Then, on June 6, it compared each country's self-assessment with the odds of its victory on oddschecker.com, a Web site that consolidates bookmakers' odds from two dozen online betting sites.
