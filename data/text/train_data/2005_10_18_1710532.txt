NED LEVI watched in amazement as a passenger grunted down the aisle with five bags on a recent flight from Philadelphia to Seattle. ''I was surprised she could even walk,'' said Mr. Levi, a computer consultant from Philadelphia. ''I was even more surprised that the flight attendants didn't try to stop her.'' His remedy for the endless boarding delays that plague airlines these days: enforce luggage limits.
Sounds reasonable, but United Airlines says it believes it has hit on a better solution. It recently announced a logistics ploy it calls Wilma -- shorthand for window-middle-aisle -- that it claims will cut boarding times by four to five minutes, an eternity in the industry's on-time takeoff sweepstakes. The idea is to fill the window seats in economy class first, then the middle seats, then the aisle seats, thereby eliminating the free-for-all chaos that clogs the cabin when passengers are sent in by row numbers.
