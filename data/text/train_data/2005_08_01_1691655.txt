The board of Cnooc, the Chinese oil company, is planning to decide early this week whether to raise its bid for Unocal or abandon its takeover effort, executives close to the company said over the weekend.
Several members of Cnooc's board and management have expressed doubts in recent days about the wisdom of continuing to pursue the bid in the face of mounting opposition in Washington, but it remained unclear yesterday which way the board would vote.
