NEVER mind the Zen conundrum about the sound of one hand clapping. What is the sound of the organization that bills itself as the voice of older Americans?
Consumers will find out soon as a result of an innovative agreement between AARP, the organization formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons, and DMI Music and Media Solutions in Pasadena, Calif. DMI, which works for marketers like Coca-Cola, Kellogg, Mattel, Procter & Gamble, Target, Toyota and United Airlines, has been hired to develop a strategy to make music and sound part of the AARP brand.
