As General Motors sells most of its 21 percent stake in the Japanese carmaker Suzuki Motor, providing a cash infusion after huge losses, analysts are wondering if the move will be enough to appease G.M.'s disgruntled shareholders. The sale has also raised speculation about what G.M. plans to do with its 7.9 percent stake in Isuzu Motors.
G.M. will sell about 92 million shares, or a 17.4 percent stake, back to Suzuki for 230 billion yen ($1.98 billion) on Tuesday, the companies said. Analysts said Suzuki might have to spread itself dangerously thin to come up with the cash on short notice to buy its shares back from G.M.
