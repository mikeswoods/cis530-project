Microsoft rode a wave of global strength in the personal computer market to report growth in profit and sales in the first quarter of its 2006 fiscal year, slightly exceeding analysts' expectations.
Microsoft, the world's largest software publisher, said Thursday that quarterly revenue was $9.74 billion, 6 percent higher than $9.19 billion in the quarter last year. Earnings rose 24 percent, to $3.14 billion, or 29 cents a share, from $2.53 billion, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier.
