Chrysler, which enjoyed great success with television ads featuring Snoop Dogg hanging out with Lee Iacocca, has returned to the hip-hop world -- this time to give a little back. Officials from Chrysler Financial, the financing arm of DaimlerChrysler, recently teamed up with the hip-hop entrepreneur Russell Simmons, the performers LL Cool J, T.I. and Nas, and the Warner Music Group executive vice president Kevin Liles to bring the concept of ''financial empowerment'' to New York.
The program was one of six being held across the country to promote the importance of financial literacy among teenagers and young adults.
