Talks by private equity firms and the majority owner of TIM Hellas, the Greek telecommunications company, again failed to produce a purchase agreement Friday, opening the door for a takeover fight.
The two firms, Apax Partners and the Texas Pacific Group, approached Telecom Italia last month about buying its 80 percent stake in TIM Hellas; analysts estimate that the stake may be worth as much as 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion). Exclusive talks among the three parties officially ended last week, but informal talks continued late Friday.
