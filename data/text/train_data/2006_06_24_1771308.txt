Alice Kissell, 58, a longtime asthma patient, still gets indignant when she recalls the brusque receptionists and hours of waiting to see a doctor at her former health maintenance organization in Southern California.
''You felt like a herd of cattle running through,'' she said. But a few years ago, she moved to Whitehouse, Tex., a small town near Tyler in the northeast part of the state. Now Ms. Kissell has a family doctor who knows her and who, despite having a thriving practice, seems never too busy to see her.
