The Pentagon introduced proposed regulations yesterday aimed at preventing marketing practices that have exposed military personnel, especially recruits and junior officers, to high-pressure or deceptive sales pitches for insurance and other financial products.
The proposed rules are the Defense Department's first official response to concerns raised in Congress last fall after reports in The New York Times documented abusive sales practices and unsuitable financial products on several military bases, including Fort Benning in Georgia and Camp Pendleton in California. Congress is considering legislation, introduced with bipartisan support, to address problems raised in the reports.
