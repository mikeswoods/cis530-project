Chrysler executives startled investors in late October when they acknowledged that the company had been building tens of thousands of cars on spec to keep its factories humming. Those cars were not included in the company's estimates of its backlog of unsold vehicles on dealer lots -- a figure that was already high by industry standards.
But Chrysler's chief executive, Thomas W. LaSorda, said Thursday on a company blog that Chrysler would continue to build cars that dealers had not ordered -- just fewer of them.
