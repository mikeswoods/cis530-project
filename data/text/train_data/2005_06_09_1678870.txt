IAC/InteractiveCorp, controlled by Barry Diller, said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its 5.4 percent stake in Vivendi Universal Entertainment for about $3.4 billion, ending a fractious partnership and allowing Mr. Diller to focus on his Internet businesses.
Vivendi Universal Entertainment is part of NBC Universal, which is 8o percent owned by General Electric and 20 percent owned by Vivendi Universal. NBC Universal is putting up roughly $900 million to buy Mr. Diller's stake in the entertainment unit, which includes cable networks, Universal Pictures and other assets. The rest of the money is coming from Vivendi Universal, and the deal resolves its legal dispute with Mr. Diller over tax liability issues.
