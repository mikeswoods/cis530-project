ConocoPhillips said Thursday that it would combine ownership of two of its refineries in Texas with Canadian oil sands properties controlled by the oil and gas producer EnCana. The two partners also agreed to invest more than $10 billion over the next decade to expand the joint venture's production.
The deal ends EnCana's long search for a partner to process the heavy tar, or bitumen, it extracts from surrounding rock and sand by injecting high-pressure steam into wells. But the decision to send more of that material to the United States for processing may prove unpopular in the company's home province, Alberta.
