Cargill, the grain marketing company, said yesterday that it would set up tax-free health savings accounts for farmers who pledge to sell a portion of their grain to the company.
The program, which company officials say is the first in the nation, is aimed at helping farmers who are struggling with rising health insurance costs while guaranteeing business for Cargill in an increasingly competitive grain market.
