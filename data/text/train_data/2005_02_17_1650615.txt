Lawyers for thousands of people who contend that they were harmed by the diet drug combination fen-phen said yesterday that they would reject a comprehensive settlement offer from Wyeth. But the company said there was a ''substantial show of interest'' in the deal.
A spokesman, Douglas Petkus, said Wyeth did not yet know how many of the 63,000 plaintiffs who had received the settlement offer would sign on, but he reiterated the company's view that its $21.1 billion litigation reserve would fully finance the remaining cases.
