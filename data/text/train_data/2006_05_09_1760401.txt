A federal prosecutor in the tax shelter trial of 16 former employees of the accounting firm KPMG said yesterday that he thought the firm should cut off their legal fees, but insisted that the government did not put pressure on it to do so.
The testimony by the prosecutor, Stanley Okula, an assistant United States attorney, came at a hearing held to determine whether Manhattan prosecutors inappropriately pressed KPMG into cutting off the legal fees for the 16 early in 2004 as a condition of not seeking indictment of the firm over its creation and sale of questionable tax shelters.
