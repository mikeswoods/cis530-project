One way of reading the new report by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety is that the Mercedes E-Class sedan has the safest design of any car or truck and the two-door Chevrolet Blazer the worst.
Another way to read the report, to be released Tuesday, is that E-Class drivers tend to drive more carefully than Blazer drivers.
