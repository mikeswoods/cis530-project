For the last six years, Working Mother magazine listed Novartis, the pharmaceutical manufacturer, as among the best 100 companies for women, citing its generous maternity leave and a program to encourage telecommuting from home.
But a dozen women sales representatives for Novartis beg to differ. In a lawsuit filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the women contend that they were discriminated against in pay and promotions, particularly after becoming pregnant. The company's products include the Gerber baby brands.
