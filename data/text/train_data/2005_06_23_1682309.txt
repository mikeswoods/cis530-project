For the last few years, some of the most gasp-inducingly thin digital cameras have been found in Casio's stylish Exilim line. The new Exilim EX-S500, just over half an inch deep at its thinnest point, continues that tradition.
The new model takes five-megapixel still images and shoots video in MPEG-4 format, at 640 by 480 pixels and 30 frames a second. Image and video information is stored on an SD card. (Get ready to pony up extra money for storage, however, as a card is not included with the camera.)
