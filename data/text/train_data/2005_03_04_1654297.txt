It took more than three years of stop-and-go negotiations, threats, political maneuvers and court battles, but the largest government debt default in history finally ended here Thursday, as the Argentine government announced that 76 percent of its creditors had accepted a proposal that will pay them at most 30 cents on each dollar.
President NÃ©stor Kirchner, who ignored suggestions that he seek a quick settlement and took an overtly confrontational approach, this week gleefully described the restructuring of $102.6 billion in bonds held mostly by foreigners as ''the greatest deal ever'' for a country in negotiations with creditors. In comparison, Russia offered bondholders half their money back after a huge default in 1998.
