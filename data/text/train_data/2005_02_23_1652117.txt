The stock price of the giant data broker ChoicePoint fell by more than 9 percent yesterday, as privacy-rights advocates, industry experts and officials in at least two states -- Georgia and Illinois -- called for closer regulation of companies that compile large databases of consumer information.
ChoicePoint sells personal data to potential employers, landlords and others conducting background checks on individuals. It revealed last week that it had been duped last year into delivering personal financial and background data on thousands of American consumers to thieves posing as legitimate business customers. The company said it had not disclosed the breach earlier because law enforcement officials had been looking into the matter.
