Eighteen employees who in recent days abruptly left the flagship New York office of Saatchi & Saatchi, where they had worked for years on the big General Mills account, are expected to announce, perhaps as soon as next week, an agreement to join the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Advertising executives who were briefed on the former employees' plans said yesterday that the group was in the final stages of negotiations to join Interpublic in one of two capacities. The executives spoke on the condition of anonymity because, they said, the plans were not final.
