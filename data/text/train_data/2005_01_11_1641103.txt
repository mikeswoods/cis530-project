Rupert Murdoch's announcement yesterday that his News Corporation would take full control of the Fox Entertainment Group sent a signal that he does not feel pressured to resolve his dispute with John C. Malone's Liberty Media Corporation before pushing ahead with other deals.
Many analysts and investors had expected that Mr. Murdoch would settle the conflict over Liberty's voting interest in the News Corporation before buying out Fox. But Mr. Murdoch went ahead yesterday and said that he would buy the 18 percent of Fox that his company did not own, in a deal worth about $6 billion.
