AIR travel is the ultimate networking opportunity. I've met some of my best clients next to a security checkpoint, at the gate or on the plane.
The circumstances are not always ideal (after all, it is air travel). But some are less ideal than others. A case in point is the business contact I made as a result of flying with an inebriated passenger.
