Advanced Micro Devices' plan to pay $5.4 billion for the graphics chip maker ATI Technologies got a negative reaction from investors and some Wall Street analysts on Monday, though analysts said the purchase would help A.M.D. compete against Intel, its much larger rival.
Hector Ruiz, A.M.D.'s chief executive, defended the deal. ''We are very bullish on the transaction,'' he told analysts in a phone briefing early Monday morning after the company announced the plan. ''We definitely think we are going to leapfrog the competition.''
