Inside the Hyatt Regency in Dearborn, Mich., Rick Wagoner, chief executive of General Motors, and other top G.M. officials were meeting on the morning of April 17 with union leaders from around the country.
Outside, a throng of reporters staked out the front and back exits. A black Cadillac sedan and a GMC Yukon sport utility were parked at the back exit, waiting, it appeared, for someone important. Just before lunchtime, a security guard stuck his head out the door and flashed a thumbs up. The two vehicles roared off, swooped around the hotel to a third, locked exit, and collected Mr. Wagoner, executing a perfect media head fake.
