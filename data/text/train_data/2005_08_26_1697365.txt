The European Commission cleared Johnson & Johnson's planned $25.4 billion takeover of the medical equipment maker Guidant after the companies agreed to sell some of their businesses, the commission said Thursday.
The approval eliminated one of the main regulatory obstacles facing the proposed deal, but the combination still faces an antitrust inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, expected to be concluded in October, the companies said.
