Royal Group Technologies, a troubled building-materials maker that many thought could not find a buyer, agreed on Friday to be acquired by Georgia Gulf, an Atlanta chemical company, for $1.2 billion Canadian dollars ($1.07 billion).
The deal includes the assumption of debt of about 500 million Canadian dollars. The offer, at 13 Canadian dollars a share, is a premium of 43.5 percent over Thursday's closing share price for Royal.
