WALL STREET has embraced real estate investment trusts as an asset family that adds diversification to portfolios, but some financial advisers still regard so-called private, or unlisted, REIT's as a kind of black sheep.
The critics say they are troubled by what they see as high up-front fees, a lack of liquidity and limited transparency in these investments, which are publicly registered but not listed on any exchange. Others, though, view them as rich income sources that provide an exposure to real estate equity without the nail-biting fluctuations of the public markets.
