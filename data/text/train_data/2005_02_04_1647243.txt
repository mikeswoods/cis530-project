TALK about zigging when others are zagging: On the Monday after the biggest day of the year for television advertising (otherwise known as Super Bowl Sunday), a leading publisher will begin what it is calling its largest effort ever to promote the power of print as a medium.
The effort comes from the Cond√© Nast Media Group in New York, a new unit of the Advance Magazine Group division of Advance Publications that oversees corporate sales and integrated marketing for more than two dozen titles. Among them are Architectural Digest, Bride's, GQ, Glamour, Golf Digest, Gourmet, House & Garden, Jane, The New Yorker, Parade, Self, Vanity Fair, Vogue and W.
