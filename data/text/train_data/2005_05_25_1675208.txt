Officials of the Food and Drug Administration and the Guidant Corporation met yesterday to discuss a company defibrillator that has partly or totally failed in 26 cases because of an electrical flaw, including an instance in March that involved the death of a college student.
The meeting followed the disclosure that Guidant had not informed doctors for three years about a design flaw in the implantable defibrillator, known as a Ventak Prizm 2 Model 1861, or told them that it had changed its manufacturing process in 2002 to fix it.
