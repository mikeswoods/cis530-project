Andrea Westmeyer, president of Relationship Marketing Inc., a communications consulting firm, knows how to make a good first impression with Fortune 500 clients. She has a well-appointed office in Rockefeller Center in Manhattan. She has a secretary who answers the phone on the first ring. And she comes across as a seasoned New Yorker -- always able to chat about restaurant openings or commiserate about finding a taxicab on a rainy Manhattan day.
But Ms. Westmeyer's company is actually based in Des Moines. She rents the Manhattan office -- along with the conference room and the secretary, who diverts her calls to Iowa -- by the hour from HQ Global Workplaces, a company that leases part-time office space, so she can meet with clients there a few times a month. Along with her monthly fee comes the privilege of having her company listed in the Rockefeller Center electronic directory and printing the renowned address on her company's business cards.
