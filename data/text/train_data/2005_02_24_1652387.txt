With its founder poised to emerge from prison next month, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia reported steep losses for last year yesterday but declared that it was focused on the future, ''with Martha's return to the company and our capacity to plan no longer clouded.''
The company said it lost $60 million for the year, nearly 10 times the $6.4 million loss it had in 2003. In the fourth quarter it lost $9.5 million, or 14 cents a share, compared with income of $2.3 million, or 5 cents a share, for the same quarter in 2003.
