When Carrie Beth Walsh and her two toddlers landed at the airport in Seoul, South Korea, last year, there was no sign of her husband, an Army pilot who had been transferred there six weeks earlier.
He eventually showed up in a taxi, broke and unprepared for his family's arrival -- no rental car for the drive to his base, no apartment, no credit cards in his wallet that were not already up against his loan limits. ''He was making more than $60,000 a year,'' Ms. Walsh said. ''But we were always broke.''
