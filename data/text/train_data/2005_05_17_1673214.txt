Joe Beane reserved a Dodge Intrepid from Dollar Rent a Car in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., recently. Or so he thought.
''At the rental counter, the associate aggressively tried to sell me an upgrade to a convertible for an additional $20 a day,'' Mr. Beane said. ''When I refused, she said the company had no full-size cars available and that I would have to wait for a car to be returned.''
