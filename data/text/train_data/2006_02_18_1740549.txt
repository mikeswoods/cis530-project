When carmakers recall a vehicle, they provide a replacement part and cover the cost of the labor to install it. But producers of expensive medical devices have found a better way -- they often have others, like taxpayers and insurers, pick up the labor cost.
Last year, for example, when Medtronic and Guidant recalled certain heart defibrillators, both companies provided new devices free and agreed to reimburse patients up to $2,500 in out-of-pocket expenses for replacement operations. About 24,000 heart patients had such procedures; some 19,000 of them with Medtronic devices and an estimated 5,000 with Guidant units.
