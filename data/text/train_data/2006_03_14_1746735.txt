Ending five years of wrangling, Exxon Mobil appeared yesterday to have reached agreement with Indonesia's state-owned oil company, Pertamina, clearing the last hurdle to developing one of the country's most promising oil deposits.
Exxon Mobil and Pertamina announced in Jakarta that they had concluded a joint-operating agreement that would allow the two companies to begin drilling for oil near the town of Cepu in eastern Java. The agreement, to be signed officially on Wednesday, calls for the establishment of a joint venture that will place executives from Exxon Mobil in charge of day-to-day operations, while Pertamina will head a joint oversight committee.
