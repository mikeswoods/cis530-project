In his first day under cross-examination, Scott D. Sullivan, the government's star witness in its case against the former WorldCom chief executive, Bernard J. Ebbers, said yesterday that he had lied dozens of times to auditors, directors and shareholders.
Mr. Sullivan's testimony in Federal District Court in Manhattan came in response to a blizzard of questions from a defense lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten, who has been trying to show that Mr. Sullivan -- and not Mr. Ebbers -- masterminded the $11 billion fraud that led to the collapse of WorldCom in 2002.
