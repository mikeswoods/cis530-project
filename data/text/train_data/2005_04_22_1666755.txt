Representative Rob Portman, President Bush's nominee to be the next United States trade representative, answered mounting criticism of the administration's trade policies on Thursday by promising that he would take a stricter approach to China if he were confirmed.
At his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Portman, a Republican from Ohio, fielded repeated questions about China's refusal to follow international trade laws, especially those covering intellectual property rights. ''We need a tougher approach,'' he said.
