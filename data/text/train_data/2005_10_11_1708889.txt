In yet another sign of the continuing effort by William Clay Ford Jr. to reshape his distressed automaker, the Ford Motor Company said Monday that two high-ranking executives were stepping aside.
The departures come from within the company's North American operations, where losses are deepening and company executives are looking to reorganize. The two executives who announced their resignations were Phil Martens, head of North American product development, and Matt DeMars, who oversaw North American manufacturing.
