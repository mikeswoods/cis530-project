With great effort and cost, a Russian drilling crew shipped a rig into an Arctic swamp far north of Moscow. They drilled for weeks through rock -- only to find more rock. After drilling eight dry holes in 2002, the crew gave up.
Going against the oilman's motto that the only geologist one can trust is ''Mr. Drill,'' a team of real geologists returned to the problem the next year. This time, equipped with 3-D imaging computers, they placed the rig with pinpoint accuracy over the Val Gamburtseva deposit. It is now producing volumes of oil.
