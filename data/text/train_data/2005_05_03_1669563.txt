Genetically modified rice could bring huge benefits to Chinese farmers, lowering their costs, improving harvest yields and greatly reducing the use of pesticides, according to a report published in the journal Science last week.
The study, conducted by American and Chinese scientists who have long backed the crops, comes as the Chinese government is deciding whether to approve the sale of genetically modified rice, which would make China the first nation to adopt biotechnology crops in one of the world's leading food staples.
