A federal judge gave preliminary approval on Monday to a proposed $195 million settlement between the accounting firm KPMG and hundreds of clients who bought certain tax shelters, but raised concerns over whether the deal was fairly reached.
The approval came after an unusual two-day hearing that pitted class-action lawyers against each other. Objectors to the settlement had argued that the law firm that brokered the deal, Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman, had colluded with KPMG and had engaged in conflicts of interest by representing individual former KPMG clients while secretly negotiating a settlement.
