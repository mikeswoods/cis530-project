Sanford I. Weill told Citigroup employees yesterday that he now planned to stay on as chairman until his scheduled retirement next April, ending an internal debate that spilled outside the bank over his plans to leave and start a private equity fund.
''It has hurt me to read speculation that in pursuing any new venture, I might somehow find myself competing with Citigroup or acting contrary to the company's interests,'' Mr. Weill said in a memorandum to employees. ''Nothing could be further from my mind. I care deeply about this company and its people. As a founder of this company, the success we have achieved together has been the highlight of my career.''
