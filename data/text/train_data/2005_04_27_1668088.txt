The federal agency that insures pensions could receive United Airlines securities worth $1 billion or more when the airline emerges from bankruptcy, according to a settlement agreement prepared for filing in federal bankruptcy court.
The settlement agreement, which listed the conditions for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to take over United's four employee pension plans, called for the agency to receive two classes of notes and $500 million of convertible preferred stock in UAL, United's parent, when the airline's reorganization is complete.
