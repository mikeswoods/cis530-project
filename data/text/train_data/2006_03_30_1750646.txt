Like most fans of the iTunes Music Store, I'm aware of its one-time download policy. Once I download a song, it's my responsibility and if lost, I will have to buy it again. Like far fewer iTunes aficionados, I finally did what Apple recommends that you do. I backed up my music.
Backing up files, by definition, requires a second hard drive. The biggest risk of data loss is disk failure, yet it never hurts to consider the possibility of theft, fire or physical damage either. It pays, then, to have an external second drive that you keep apart from your computer.
