A three-year-old federal law that provided a backstop to insurance companies in the event of a terrorist attack should not be extended in its current form, Bush administration officials said yesterday.
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act was approved in the wake of the attacks of 2001, when many insurers stopped providing terrorism coverage or made it extremely costly. Scheduled to expire at the end of this year, it requires the federal government to cover 90 percent of combined damages in excess of $15 billion and up to $100 billion.
