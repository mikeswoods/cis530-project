Brendan McGahan, 26, rips off his headset and darts from his cubicle looking for a supervisor. ''I'm getting close to an escalation,'' he says over the drone of other cubicle dwellers.
Just out of the Air Force, Mr. McGahan recently landed a job that entails keeping frustrated Cingular Wireless customers from losing it. He is a trainee in the customer service center here, and he has a live one on the line: the caller complains he cannot hear well on his mobile phone and is demanding a free replacement.
