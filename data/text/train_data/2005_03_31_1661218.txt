Saks Inc., the department store company, has put its regional stores up for sale and is considering selling its crown jewel, the Saks Fifth Avenue chain, executives close to the company said yesterday.
The board of Saks has hired the investment bank Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to ''explore strategic alternatives'' for its properties, the executives said last night.
