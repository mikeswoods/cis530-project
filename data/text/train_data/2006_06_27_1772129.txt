The takeover of Arcelor by Mittal Steel claimed its first victim on Monday in the person of the chief executive of Arcelor, Guy Dollé, who used some of the toughest -- and some observers said insulting -- language during the five bruising months of negotiations for the deal.
Arcelor's chairman, Joseph Kinsch, who is keeping his position with the new company, said that Mr. Dollé would stay on until Arcelor selected a chief executive for the new Arcelor-Mittal.
