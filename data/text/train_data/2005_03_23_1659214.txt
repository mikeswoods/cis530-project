The SCi Entertainment Group, a British video game maker, made a surprise £76.1 million ($144.5 million) bid on Tuesday for a rival company, Eidos, a move that could ignite a takeover battle for Eidos.
SCi's offer came about 13 hours after Elevation Partners, a private equity firm that counts the singer Bono among its managers, said it would pay £74 million ($139 million) for Eidos.
