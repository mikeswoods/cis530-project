''Short selling,'' thundered Representative Adolph J. Sabath, Democrat of Illinois, ''is the greatest evil that has been permitted or sanctioned by the government that I know of.'' It was, in short, the cause of the Great Depression.
He was speaking at a House hearing in 1932 on his bill to make short selling illegal. Had such a ban been in place in 1929, he said, ''I am satisfied that not one-half of the banks that were closed nor of the factories or other plants that were closed would have been closed, and there would not be eight million or nine million people out of employment, nor would there have been over 20 million people who lost all they possessed, due to the manipulation on the stock exchanges.''
