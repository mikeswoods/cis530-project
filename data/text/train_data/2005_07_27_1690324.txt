TV Guide previewed a new design yesterday as the magazine looks to stem its declining advertising and circulation in recent years.
In October, the book-sized title will become full-size, and every page will have color. And instead of being 75 percent television listings and 25 percent feature articles, it will be the other way around, said the magazine's parent company, Gemstar-TV Guide International.
