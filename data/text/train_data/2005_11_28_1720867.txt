The cover of a certain magazine's ''Katrina Special'' features a displaced Gulf Coast resident with the caption: ''My name is Sally. I'm from New Orleans.'' Sally is a pit bull mix and the publication is Bark, an 8-year-old quarterly that Time has called ''the New Yorker of dog magazines.''
The issue, which includes features about people reunited with dogs and articles about pet-rescue efforts, is decidedly newsy for a magazine usually dedicated to such ephemera as dog-park intrigue and how to meditate with your pet.
