LAUREN ZIEJA, a store security manager in Pompton Lakes, N.J., lives where she always has: with Mom and Dad. They don't ask her to pay rent, for groceries or any other household expenses. Therefore, Ms. Zieja, 28, socks away $600 to $1,000 a month toward an eventual departure from the roost.
Last year, she sprang a nice surprise on her parents: a hot tub. ''It's certainly nothing we asked for,'' said her mother, Clarice Zieja, 54. ''It was her way of saying, 'Thanks, Mom and Dad.'''
