Wal-Mart Stores, which is fighting the nation's largest sex discrimination lawsuit, will set up a $25 million private equity fund to support businesses owned by women and members of minority groups over the next five years, the retailer said yesterday.
The fund will invest in businesses that offer merchandise and services to retailers with the goal of diversifying the industry's suppliers. Of Wal-Mart's 61,000 United States suppliers, 5,200 are owned by women and minority group members, the company said.
