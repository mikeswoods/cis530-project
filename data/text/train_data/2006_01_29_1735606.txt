BARBARA RICE, a former high school teacher in Pittsburgh, never gave retirement much thought -- except when she dreamed of how nice it would be not to have to wake up at 5:30 a.m. every day. Then, after 30 years at the same school, she accepted an early-retirement package and suddenly found herself able to do whatever she wanted.
That was five years ago. Today, at 57, Mrs. Rice is back at work, not as a teacher but as a bookseller on the floor of a local Borders store. ''I don't need the income,'' she said, ''I call it a hobby job.'' And she has no plans to stop working. ''The concept of sitting in a rocking chair and retiring just doesn't exist anymore,'' she said.
