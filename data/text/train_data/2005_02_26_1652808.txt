The Sankyo Company said Friday that it would buy its smaller rival, Daiichi Pharmaceutical, in a $7.7 billion deal that would secure Sankyo's place as Japan's second-largest drug maker.
The takeover is the latest in a string of mergers and buyouts among Japanese drug makers amid falling prices, rising development costs and worries about becoming the target of a foreign takeover.
