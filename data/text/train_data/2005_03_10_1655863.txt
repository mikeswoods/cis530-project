James A. Bell, the newly named interim chief executive of the Boeing Company, made his Wall Street debut yesterday at an investor conference, stressing continuity while making it clear he had no plans to remain in the position.
''Clearly we are disappointed and saddened by the circumstances of the resignation of Harry Stonecipher,'' said Mr. Bell, 56, who had been chief financial officer and was elevated on Monday after the sudden departure of Mr. Stonecipher, who was ousted for having a personal relationship with a female Boeing executive.
