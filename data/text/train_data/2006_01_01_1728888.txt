THE United States is hardly alone in having a surfeit of overly chubby children. The World Health Organization estimates that a tenth of children ages 5 to 17 worldwide are overweight, and that 30 million to 45 million qualify as obese.
The situation is particularly dire in Scotland, where the popularity of deep-fried foods -- from fish to pizza -- has helped to balloon more than a third of 12-year-olds beyond their recommended weights; in the United States, the overweight rate is about 30 percent.
