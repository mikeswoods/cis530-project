To disguise a payoff to a radio programmer at KHTS in San Diego, Epic Records called a flat-screen television a ''contest giveaway.'' Epic, part of Sony BMG Music Entertainment, used the same gambit in delivering a laptop computer to the program director of WRHT in Greenville, N.C. -- who also received PlayStation 2 games and an out-of-town trip with his girlfriend.
In another example, a Sony BMG executive considered a plan to promote the song ''A.D.I.D.A.S.'' by Killer Mike by sending radio disc jockeys one Adidas sneaker, with the promise of the second one when they had played the song 10 times.
