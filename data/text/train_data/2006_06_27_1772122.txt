In the face of government pressure, a group of Internet companies is undertaking a cooperative effort to help combat child pornography online.
The group, organized last week by AOL, includes Yahoo, Microsoft, Earthlink and United Online. It will initially pay $1 million for a new project of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that will develop systems meant to help identify child exploitation on the Internet and refer cases to law enforcement.
