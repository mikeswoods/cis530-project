Few executives have helped create and then watched the destruction of as much wealth as Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom.
With resolve and salesmanship, but little training in finance or engineering, Mr. Ebbers built one of the world's largest telecommunications companies -- at its peak worth $160 billion. Now, with WorldCom in tatters, he stands accused of masterminding a record $11 billion accounting fraud that toppled the company he created and left investors, former employees and others to pick up the pieces.
