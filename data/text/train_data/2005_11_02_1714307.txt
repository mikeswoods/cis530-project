Jamie Olis, a former midlevel executive at Dynegy who was sentenced last year to 24 years in prison for accounting fraud, can breathe a little easier.
A federal appeals court has ordered a judge in Houston to revise the sentence for Mr. Olis, 39, a tax accountant who helped devise a secret project in 2001 to disguise a $300 million loan as cash flow. Among those convicted for white-collar crimes in recent memory, Mr. Olis's eye-popping sentence has been surpassed only by the 25-year prison term given in July to Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chairman of WorldCom.
