You can't keep a good cookie guy down.
Wally Amos, who as ''Famous Amos'' became well known in the 1970's for his chocolate chip cookies and efforts to fight adult illiteracy, is at it again: he and his wife, Christine, have started a new company -- Chip & Cookie -- that has a store in Kailua on Oahu in Hawaii and plans to distribute its cookie dough this year through Costco stores in California and Hawaii. Ten percent of profit will go toward a new foundation to promote the importance of adults reading to children.
