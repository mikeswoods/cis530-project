Genentech Inc.'s cancer drug Avastin prolonged the lives of patients with advanced lung cancer in a clinical trial, a result that sent the company's shares soaring and could pave the way for wider use of what is widely considered the company's most promising product.
In the trial, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, patients who received Avastin along with standard chemotherapy drugs had a median survival of 12.5 months, compared with 10.2 months for those receiving only the chemotherapy.
