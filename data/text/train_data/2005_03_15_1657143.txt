Here's how many miles I just spent to get one free business-class ticket from New York to Shanghai and back next November -- and not even on the days I had originally wanted to fly: 240,000.
My wife, my mother-in-law and I are going to Shanghai to visit relatives. My wife booked her business-class award ticket and her mother's more than six weeks ago. Their tickets cost 270,000 miles for the two.
