As part of a wide-ranging investigation into the company's possibly questionable transactions, regulators are looking at the close relationship between A.I.G. and C.V. Starr and Starr International. A.I.G. does business with both entities, which are significant A.I.G. shareholders. A.I.G. has disclosed little about the companies, whose shareholders are all A.I.G. executives and managers.
