The health insurer Aetna said yesterday that it would not pay for a nerve-stimulating implant the government has approved as a last-ditch treatment for severe depression.
While some analysts said the national noncoverage decision is a continuation of existing policy that came as no surprise, investors saw it as a blow for the device's manufacturer, Cyberonics. The company, based in Houston, has been citing previous case-by-case approvals of coverage by 8 of Aetna's more than 50 local and regional health plans as a sign of growing acceptance of the device among insurers.
