All Robert Herron wanted from the concierge at the Doubletree Hotel in Savannah, Ga., were directions to the Lady & Sons, a popular seafood restaurant. What he got was an aggressive pitch to dine elsewhere. And when he declined, he was sent to the wrong address.
''I have never experienced anything like it,'' said Mr. Herron, a general contractor from Fernley, Nev. ''The concierge was very polite but pushy about these other restaurants. I began to suspect that there might be some kind of arrangement with those places; maybe he or the hotel was getting a referral fee or some kind of kickback. Otherwise, why would he be so insistent?''
