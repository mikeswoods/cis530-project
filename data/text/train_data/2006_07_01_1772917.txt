Michaels Stores, which has ridden a wave of baby boomer interest in homespun projects like scrapbooks and sewing to become the nation's largest arts and crafts retailer, agreed to be sold yesterday to a consortium of private equity firms for more than $6 billion.
A group that includes Bain Capital and the Blackstone Group beat Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and the Texas Pacific Group as bidders for the 900-store chain.
