Kimberley A. Strassel, a member of The Wall Street Journal's editorial board, has been named the paper's new Washington columnist.
Ms. Strassel, 33, will be resuming the weekly Potomac Watch column, which has been in hiatus for the last five years. It ceased when Paul A. Gigot, who wrote the column for 14 years, left Washington for New York in August 2001 to become The Journal's editorial page editor. His column won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 2000.
