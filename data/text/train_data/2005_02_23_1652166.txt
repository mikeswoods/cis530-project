TWO former top executives of the flagship New York office of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide were found guilty yesterday of overbilling a federal antidrug agency for advertising work.
The executives, Thomas Early, 49, and Shona Seifert, 44, were each convicted on all 10 counts -- one count of conspiracy and nine of making false claims -- by a jury in United States District Court in Manhattan. The two, both former senior partners, are to be sentenced by Judge Richard M. Berman on May 16.
