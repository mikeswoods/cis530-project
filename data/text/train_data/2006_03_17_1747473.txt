Michael A. Carpenter, a longtime Citigroup executive who at one time was thought to be a contender for the bank's top job, is leaving the company in the latest departure among senior management.
Mr. Carpenter, 58, the head of the alternative investments group, will leave by May 1 and is expected to start an ''entrepreneurial venture'' like a private equity or hedge fund, according to a memo yesterday from Charles O. Prince III, Citigroup's chief executive.
