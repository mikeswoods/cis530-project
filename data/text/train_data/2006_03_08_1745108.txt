As the Bush administration re-examines a proposal to allow a Dubai company to take over operations at some American ports, executives from unrelated businesses have quietly begun lobbying in Dubai's favor, fearing that recent fierce criticism could damage trade with the United Arab Emirates.
Some corporate groups are also planning public moves to smooth relations between the United States and Dubai. The American Business Group of another emirate, Abu Dhabi, is set to announce today that it will send seven delegates to Washington at the end of the month to speak to lawmakers. The group has several hundred corporate members, including Lockheed Martin, Federal Express, the Hilton Group and Exxon Mobil.
