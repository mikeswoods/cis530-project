Leaders of the United Automobile Workers union, who met Wednesday in Detroit, said they doubted that a deal could be reached on an assistance plan for the Delphi Corporation before a deadline on March 31.
Without an agreement by the union and General Motors, Delphi, an auto parts supplier that is under bankruptcy protection, says it will ask a judge for permission to set aside its labor contracts and impose sharply lower wages. The U.A.W. has threatened to strike if that happens.
