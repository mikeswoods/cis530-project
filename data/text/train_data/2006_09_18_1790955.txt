TWO hours before his flight to Los Angeles, Mordechai Cohen lay on his back in the basement of McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, pumping iron.
Mr. Cohen muscled out one set of bench presses, then another. Around him, other guests at the 24 Hour Fitness gym near Terminals C and D were engaged in similar pursuits -- running on treadmills, bicycling in place, curling dumbbells. It was 8 a.m., when many visitors to Sin City call it a night. For Mr. Cohen, a long day was just beginning.
