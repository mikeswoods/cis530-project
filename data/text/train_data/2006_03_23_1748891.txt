It started when I decided I needed a new high-end PC for a book I'm writing on Vista, the much-delayed next generation of the Windows operating system.
I wanted a machine with the latest Intel dual-core processor, two gigabytes of memory and a high-capacity hard drive. Because I needed to switch back and forth between Windows XP and my beta copy of Vista, I wanted two removable hard drives that I could swap in and out.
