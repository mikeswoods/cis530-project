A British court provided a mixed verdict for Pfizer in a crucial patent dispute yesterday, upholding one of the company's British patents on Lipitor, the company's best-selling cholesterol-lowering medicine, but invalidating a second one.
The ruling, by Justice Nicholas Pumfrey of the High Court in London, will have no practical effect on Pfizer's control over Lipitor in Britain because the court upheld a patent that covers the main active ingredient in the drug. That patent does not expire until November 2011.
