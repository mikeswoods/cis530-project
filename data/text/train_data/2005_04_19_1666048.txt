An executive at the American International Group, the insurance giant, has been put on leave amid a sweeping investigation into the company's accounting.
The executive, Michael J. Castelli, a former comptroller who was appointed chief administrative officer and a senior vice president in January, was put on leave recently, a company spokesman said. The spokesman declined to comment on why Mr. Castelli was put on leave.
