The stock market fell for its third consecutive week as rising oil prices and declining consumer confidence deepened the slump of 2005.
There has not been a week of net gains for the market since the year began. On Friday, crude oil prices in New York reached $48.53 a barrel, the highest since Nov. 30, and the University of Michigan's consumer confidence index showed a decline for December. Both factors weighed on the market.
