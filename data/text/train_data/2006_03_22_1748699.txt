Prices at the wholesale level dropped unexpectedly in February, the Labor Department reported yesterday, but excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, the cost of goods increased, highlighting the potential for higher inflation later in the year.
Retreating food and energy prices drove down the Producer Price Index by 1.4 percent, the biggest monthly drop in almost three years, after increases of 0.3 percent in January and 0.6 percent in December. Energy prices fell 4.7 percent and food prices were down 2.7 percent.
