AS the frenzied pace of downtown residential development slows in major cities like New York and Chicago, some second- and third-tier markets are just now experiencing an upswing. Especially in cities, like Nashville, where no residential population had existed, people are suddenly hungry for an urban lifestyle and are willing to pay for it.
Although Nashville never hit the skids the way other cities did in the 1960's and 70's -- it remained relatively safe and clean with a lively night life -- virtually no one lived in the central business district, even though the city added 60,000 people from 1990 to 2000.
