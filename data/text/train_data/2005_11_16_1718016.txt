The global music giant Sony BMG yesterday announced plans to recall millions of CD's by at least 20 artists -- from the crooners Celine Dion and Neil Diamond to the country-rock act Van Zant -- because they contain copy restriction software that poses risks to the computers of consumers.
The move, more commonly associated with collapsing baby strollers, exploding batteries, or cars with faulty brakes, is expected to cost the company tens of millions of dollars. Sony BMG said that all CD's containing the software would be removed from retail outlets and that exchanges would be offered to consumers who had bought any of them.
