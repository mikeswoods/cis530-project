With Martha Stewart's release from prison a few days away, the longtime publisher of her company's magazines has resigned.
The publisher, Suzanne Sobel, said in a statement yesterday that she was leaving ''to seek out new challenges.'' She is also an executive vice president of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Ms. Sobel joined the company in 1991 and became publisher of Martha Stewart Living in 1997, according to the company's Web site. The company said yesterday that Lauren Podlach Stanich, another executive vice president and the president of publishing, would take over for Ms. Sobel during the search for a successor.
