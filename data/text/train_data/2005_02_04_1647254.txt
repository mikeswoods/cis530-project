A sportswriter for The Worcester Telegram & Gazette in Massachusetts was fired yesterday after the newspaper determined that he had plagiarized a column in Sports Illustrated magazine and had lifted material from other publications at least six times.
The editor of the newspaper, Harry Whitin, said late yesterday that the writer, Ken Powers, covered the New England Patriots and was in Jacksonville, Fla., to cover the Super Bowl, when the newspaper received two tips about similarities between a Jan. 24 column by Peter King on the Sports Illustrated Web site and a Jan. 30 column by Mr. Powers.
