A $40 billion deal by the copper miner Phelps Dodge to acquire Inco and Falconbridge, two major nickel producers in Canada, could yet be upset by another bid, analysts say.
The Swiss-based mining company Xstrata is not expected to abandon its pursuit of Falconbridge. And even if it defies those expectations, Xstrata will still emerge a winner thanks to the premium it would receive on the 20 percent stake it holds in Falconbridge.
