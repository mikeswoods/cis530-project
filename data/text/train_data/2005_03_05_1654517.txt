Top executives of Aon, the world's second-largest insurance broker, directed transactions that helped mislead customers and possibly increased costs for them, the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, said yesterday. The accusations were made in a complaint that was filed as the company reached settlements with New York, Connecticut and Illinois.
To end the investigations, Aon agreed to pay restitution of $190 million to its customers and pledged to conduct business fairly and openly.
