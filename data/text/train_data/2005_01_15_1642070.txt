Charter Communications, the cable company controlled by Microsoft's co-founder Paul G. Allen, is struggling to hang on to subscribers even as it is weighed down by a hefty $19 billion in debt. Charter continues to lose tens of millions of dollars, and its stock trades at a mere $2 a share.
But the company has regained the confidence of once-skeptical lenders. Indeed, lenders are so confident, they have bid Charter's $6.5 billion in loans at 100.25 percent of face value, even though there is no chance lenders will get more than 100 cents back. That is up from a price of just 83 cents on the dollar less than three years ago.
