Raymond V. Gilmartin resigned yesterday as chairman and chief executive of Merck, ending a troubled decade-long term during which Merck lost its place as the world's pre-eminent drug maker and was forced into a product recall that has clouded its future.
Merck, the third-largest American drug maker, named an insider, Richard T. Clark, 59, its head of manufacturing, as the new chief executive. Merck said the chairman's position would remain vacant for at least a year.
