The stock market was decent to investors in 2004, as the 9 percent gain for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index pretty much matched the consensus forecast.
The biggest contributors to the increase were ExxonMobil, General Electric and Johnson & Johnson. Based on last year's performance and their weighting in the S.& P. 500 index, they accounted for about 1.6 percentage points of the year's gain, according to Standard & Poor's.
