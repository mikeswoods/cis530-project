Carl C. Icahn, the investor, has increased his stake in Time Warner  and is challenging the track record of the company's senior managers and directors, dating back to its merger with America Online. The moves are a part of his campaign to push for changes and board seats at the media conglomerate.
Mr. Icahn is expected to say in a letter to Time Warner shareholders, to be filed with regulators as soon as this morning, that the company's board and top management have produced a ''dismal record of mistakes and inaction'' since the AOL merger in 2000. The letter notes that 12 of Time Warner's 15 current directors -- including the chairman and chief executive Richard D. Parsons -- voted in favor of the combination that led to the loss of more than 75 percent of the company's market value over two years.
