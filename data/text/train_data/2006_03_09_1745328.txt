The New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, accused the radio giant Entercom Communications yesterday of soliciting money and gifts from record companies in exchange for playing songs on the air.
The lawsuit is the first time that Mr. Spitzer has focused his continuing payola investigation on a broadcaster. The suit accuses senior executives at Entercom, the nation's fifth-biggest radio chain, of directing efforts to extract improper payments from record companies and independent promoters, who are middlemen hired to pitch songs.
