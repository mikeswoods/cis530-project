General Motors said Wednesday that it was holding discussions with the investment firm run by its biggest shareholder, Kirk Kerkorian, about board representation for his company.
It is not clear how many seats Mr. Kerkorian's company, the Tracinda Corporation, is seeking. But one most likely would go to Jerome B. York, 67, a longtime adviser to Mr. Kerkorian and a former chief financial officer of the Chrysler Corporation.
