The Fox television executive who is taking over as president of the Paramount Pictures unit of Viacom said Wednesday that she would approach her job with humility because of her inexperience with feature films.
Gail Berman, who was named by Paramount's new chairman, Brad Grey, said that she would leave the Fox Broadcasting Company, where she has served as entertainment president since May 2000, after a transition period of about six weeks. She is being succeeded at Fox by Peter Liguori of the FX cable channel.
