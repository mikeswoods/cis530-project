For the past decade, the liquor industry has stood by quietly as sales of both light beer and diet soda have gone through the roof. Now one liquor company wants a piece of the lucrative market for low-calorie beverages.
In April, Bacardi Global Brands plans to introduce a flavored rum called Island Breeze that is promoted as having half the calories of regular rum or vodka. Unlike other flavored liquors, Island Breeze has no added sugar and is sweetened with sucralose, the popular artificial sweetener that is popping up in everything from peanut butter to orange juice.
