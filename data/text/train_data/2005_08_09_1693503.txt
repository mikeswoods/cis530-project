Regulators accused two former Citigroup executives of securities fraud yesterday, contending that they shortchanged mutual fund investors by denying them certain discounts.
The Securities and Exchange Commission sued the two executives, Thomas W. Jones and Lewis E. Daidone, over Citigroup's creation of a transfer agent to serve its Smith Barney family of mutual funds at steeply discounted rates. Rather than pass the discounts to the funds' shareholders, Citigroup reaped $128 million in profits over five years. Lawyers for the two men said they would fight the lawsuit.
