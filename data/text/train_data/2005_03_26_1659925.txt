Thomas M. Coughlin, who recently retired as vice chairman of Wal-Mart Stores, resigned from the company's board yesterday after the company raised questions about his knowledge of fraudulent expense reports and invoices.
Wal-Mart said it asked Mr. Coughlin to resign after a disagreement over the results of its investigation into the possible misappropriation of $100,000 to $500,000 in corporate funds. The company is looking into employee reimbursements that were based on false expense reports, as well as the unauthorized use of ''corporate-owned gift cards,'' Wal-Mart said in a statement filed late yesterday with securities regulators.
