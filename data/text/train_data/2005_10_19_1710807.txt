Anheuser-Busch said yesterday that it was ending its promotion of Bud Pong, a game created by the brewery that is similar to a popular drinking game called beer pong but supposedly played with water. It said it notified distributors the promotion was over after executives found Bud Pong was being played improperly.
Francine I. Katz, vice president for communications and consumer affairs, said, ''Despite our explicit guidelines, there may have been instances where this promotion was not carried out in the manner it was intended.''
