Saudi Arabia said Tuesday that it hoped to build a Middle East financial district in the capital city, Riyadh, and to sell a majority stake in its stock exchange, the Tadawul, to investors.
The changes follow a recent drop in the value of the companies traded on the Tadawul. Oil money helped to pump up stock exchanges across the Middle East in the last year, but in recent months some have experienced corrections.
