The judge in the retrial of L. Dennis Kozlowski and his top lieutenant unsealed two notes yesterday from jurors. The notes were sent to the judge during the fifth day of deliberations, which ended in guilty verdicts. At the time, the judge, Michael J. Obus of New York State Supreme Court, sealed the notes because of worries that the news media would speculate on the possibility of a hung jury.
Mr. Kozlowski's first trial resulted in a mistrial after one juror holding out for an acquittal made what appeared to be an ''O.K.'' signal to the defense. One note from the second trial said: ''One of the jurors is not participating with the rest of the group.'' The note was signed by the foreman, Isaac Rosenthal, and by jurors Ken Behm and Robert Aiken, and another juror whose name was not legible.
