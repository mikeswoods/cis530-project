For further evidence that the Internet can be complementary to print, consider this: Radar magazine, which folded two years ago and is being revived in May, is starting a Web site before publishing the magazine itself.
Come the end of April, visitors to the Web site (www.radarmagazine.com) will be reintroduced to Radar, which its founders are trying to make irreverent, urban and fun. Then, by the time the magazine comes out on May 24, readers will have been primed for the first issue and be looking forward to the next.
