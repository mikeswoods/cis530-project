GIVEN the hazards of hang gliding, it is a bit disquieting to hear Mike Meier, an owner of the glider manufacturer Wills Wing, say that the trial and error method is integral to the company's design process. Rest assured, however, that Mr. Meier was not implying that test pilots are placed in unnecessary peril. The minor errors to which he referred affect in-flight speed and handling, not safety.
The 32 years spent correcting such flaws have led to the company's T2 model, which will soon replace Will Wing's previous top-of-the-line hang glider, the Talon. Though the two gliders are tough to distinguish from each other with the naked eye, Mr. Meier said that the T2 offered approximately 1 percent better overall performance than its predecessor.
