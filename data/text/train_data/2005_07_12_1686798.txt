Shares of DreamWorks Animation SKG tumbled 13.2 percent yesterday after the company lowered its earnings estimates because of disappointing DVD sales and also pulled back on a planned $500 million stock offering.
In addition, the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission had started an informal investigation into the trading of its securities after a report on May 10 that news of disappointing first-quarter earnings had been released before the company announcement.
