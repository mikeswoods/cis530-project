Oracle announced on Tuesday that it was planning to make a cash offer on Wednesday to purchase the software maker Retek, spurring a possible bidding war with SAP, its main rival in the corporate software market.
Oracle's bid of $9 a share, or $525 million, bests SAP's bid of $496 million, made on Feb. 28. Retek, which is based in Minneapolis and specializes in software packages that large retail chains like Best Buy and Gap use to run their businesses, had already agreed to be acquired by SAP.
