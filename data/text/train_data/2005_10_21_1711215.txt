A federal magistrate judge decided on Thursday that a former partner at KPMG, the accounting firm whose tax shelters are the subject of a federal investigation, should not be released on bail and should be transported to the federal court in Manhattan where he was indicted on Monday.
The former partner, David Greenberg, was arrested Monday in Los Angeles; his lawyers sought to have him released on bail, but prosecutors charged that Mr. Greenberg was a flight risk and a danger to the community.
