John C. Malone, the media industry financier, moved a step closer to carving up what remains of his United States holdings yesterday. He completed the spinoff of Liberty Media's 50 percent interest in the cable channel group Discovery Communications to shareholders. On their first trading day, the shares closed at $15.09, up 24 cents.
Now, Mr. Malone's plans for the rest of Liberty Media's assets may soon call for even more reorganizations, according to people briefed on the situation. One strategy under discussion would have Mr. Malone increasing his 18 percent interest in the News Corporation but allowing his sometime ally Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, to vote the shares.
