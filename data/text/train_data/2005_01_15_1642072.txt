The most important part of Linda Mason's new job at CBS News may well be making sure that old rules are followed.
In the next few weeks Ms. Mason, who oversaw the revision of CBS's news-gathering policies in 1999, will assume the title of senior vice president for standards and practices. The promotion is part of CBS News's response to the conclusions of an independent panel's investigation of how CBS came to broadcast a report that the network later had to repudiate, on President Bush's National Guard service.
