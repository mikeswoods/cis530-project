It is lunchtime at Grover Cleveland High School in Portland, Ore. A steady stream of thirsty teenagers poke dollars into the three Coca-Cola machines in the hallway. By the end of lunch period, the Coke With Lime, Cherry Coke and Vanilla Coke are sold out.
Elsa Peterson, a senior at Grover Cleveland and the student body president, said she knew she could bring healthier juices from home. ''But it's easy to walk up with a dollar and just get a pop.''
