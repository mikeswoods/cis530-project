Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, said on Monday that it planned to buy Hexal of Germany and its affiliate Eon Labs of New York for $8.4 billion in cash, creating the world's biggest maker of generic drugs.
Hexal, which had sales of 1.3 billion euros ($1.7 billion) last year, would bring Novartis more than 120 new products, among them painkillers and cholesterol drugs, while Eon would bring a low-cost copy of a popular antidepressant and an extensive pipeline of new generic medicines.
