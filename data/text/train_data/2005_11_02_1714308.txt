A New York state judge indicated yesterday that he would deny a motion by Richard A. Grasso, the former New York Stock Exchange chairman, to limit a lawsuit that seeks the return of more than $100 million of Mr. Grasso's compensation.
Gerson A. Zweifach, a lawyer for Mr. Grasso, argued that the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, did not have the authority to bring four of the six claims brought against Mr. Grasso.
