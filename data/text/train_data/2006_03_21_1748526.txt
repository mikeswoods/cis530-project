BECAUSE I fly mostly out of Newark, a big Continental hub where the carrier has kept its fares competitive with low-cost airlines, I assiduously racked up the minimum number of miles for several years to maintain the top frequent-flier status level, Platinum Elite.
Alas, in 2005, I didn't fly the minimum number of miles (75,000) for top status this year. So, Continental busted me down to the middle-status tier, Gold Elite (which requires an annual minimum of 50,000 miles).
