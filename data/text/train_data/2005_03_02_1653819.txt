The mall that shares the name of this prosperous Philadelphia suburb was the first enclosed shopping center east of the Mississippi, and these days it is showing its age. Its interior is a pastiche of styles from successive remodeling efforts, and its exterior has a fortresslike appearance that betrays its 1961 origins.
Annual sales at Cherry Hill are $450 a square foot, well above the industry average of $366, but executives of Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust, or Preit, a Philadelphia company that bought the mall from the Rouse Company in 2003, say it could be more successful.
