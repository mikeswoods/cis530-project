The American International Group, the insurance giant under scrutiny for using transactions to improve its financial statements, will have to delay the filing of its annual 10-K report as it continues to wade through extensive accounting problems, people briefed on the continuing investigation said last night.
The company will announce before the stock market opens on Monday that it will reduce its net worth by a total of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion, an increase of $1 billion to $1.2 billion from the company's earlier estimate of $1.7 billion, or 2 percent of shareholders' equity. A.I.G. is expected to release additional unaudited financial information on Monday, as well as an update on its internal review.
