The struggling Jaguar Cars division of Ford Motor yesterday named the London and New York offices of Euro RSCG/Fuel, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide division of Havas, the global creative agency of record on its account.
Billings on the assignment, which had been handled for four years by the Irvine, Calif., and London offices of Young & Rubicam, part of the Young & Rubicam Brands division of the WPP Group, were estimated at more than $100 million.
