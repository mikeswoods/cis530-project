Rising oil prices and climbing bond yields set back the stock market last week. All three major stock indexes lost ground, and they ended the week in negative territory for the year.
The main culprit was the jump in the price of crude oil, which on Wednesday briefly matched its record high of $55.65 a barrel in futures trading in New York. The surging oil price had repercussions in the bond market, where concerns mounted over inflation in the broader economy. Prices fell and yields rose. The yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note moved up to 4.54 percent by Friday, from 4.31 percent the previous week, for the biggest weekly jump since May.
