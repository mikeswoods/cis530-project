MOST people, if trapped in a burning building, would call 911. But in Taito's puzzle game Exit, those in peril instead pick up their charred phone books and look under ''escapologists'' for the number of Mr. Escape, a zoot-suited hero-for-hire. Even if you've been snowed in by an avalanche or hit by a flood, Mr. Escape will be glad to help. Just make sure to have your credit card handy.
Mr. Escape navigates through crumbling buildings, pushing crates together to form makeshift staircases, clambering up ladders and leaping chasms to save clients.
