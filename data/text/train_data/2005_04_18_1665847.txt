The Intel Corporation is expected to announce today that it has begun selling a computer chip designed to pick up long-range high-speed wireless Internet signals.
The chip is designed to be built into modems, enabling them to pick up so-called WiMax transmissions, which can carry data traffic over more than 20 miles. The technology is seen as both complement and successor to Wi-Fi transmissions, which send data over shorter distances.
