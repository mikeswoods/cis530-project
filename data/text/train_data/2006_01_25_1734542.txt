Donald J. Trump, the real estate investor, said yesterday that he had filed a lawsuit against Timothy L. O'Brien, who wrote ''TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald,'' and the book's publisher, Warner Books, for making what Mr. Trump called ''egregiously false and malicious statements.'' Mr. O'Brien is also a reporter for The New York Times.
At issue is Mr. Trump's net worth, which Mr. O'Brien reported was $150 million to $250 million, citing three people with direct knowledge of Mr. Trump's finances. Mr. Trump contends that his net worth is at least $2.7 billion.
