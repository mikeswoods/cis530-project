Eleven Army officers at Fort Benning, Ga., have been disciplined for allowing life insurance agents to give improper classroom sales pitches to hundreds of trainees at the base last spring, in violation of military rules, according to the base legal office.
The base commander, Brig. Gen. Benjamin C. Freakley, has also ordered a broad training initiative ''to make sure that each soldier is personally aware of the obligation to prevent and report unauthorized solicitation'' by commercial vendors on base, said Lt. Col. Ralph Tremaglio, the base's deputy staff judge advocate.
