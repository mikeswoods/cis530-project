The Justice Department said yesterday that it had reached a settlement in a civil-fraud-claims lawsuit with Mario J. Gabelli, the money manager, over accusations that he orchestrated a scheme to deceive the Federal Communications Commission in its auction of wireless spectrum licenses several years ago.
The settlement was disclosed in Federal District Court in Manhattan yesterday. The terms of the deal were not announced, but several reports yesterday said that Mr. Gabelli was expected to pay the government more than $100 million.
