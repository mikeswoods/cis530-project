THE troubled Interpublic Group of Companies, struggling on several fronts, suddenly finds itself fighting to hold onto one of its biggest clients, Bank of America.
The Bank of America Corporation, which uses more than a dozen Interpublic agencies for tasks like advertising, direct marketing, media buying and interactive campaigns, has contacted Interpublic's biggest competitors, the Omnicom Group and the WPP Group, about the possibility of their agencies coming to work for the company. Interpublic is the third-largest agency company in revenue, behind Omnicom and WPP.
