ONE of the most revealing, and funniest, scenes in this expos√© of union corruption concerns the Mason Tenders District Council of New York, which represents workers in some of the grittiest jobs in construction. The members make good money -- $30 to $43 an hour, plus benefits. But in one job site after another in the 1980's, they were replaced by cheap unorganized labor. Where was the union?
At least until recently, says Robert Fitch in ''Solidarity for Sale: How Corruption Destroyed the Labor Movement and Undermined America's Promise'' (PublicAffairs, $28.50), it was controlled by crime families like the Genoveses and Gambinos. The ''mobbed up'' bosses were extorting payoffs from building companies in return for letting them hire nonunion labor.
