A major airline union called on the Transportation Department yesterday to convene a summit meeting of management, labor and consumer groups to find ways to help the struggling industry.
The request came in a letter to the transportation secretary, Norman Y. Mineta, from Robert Roach Jr., vice president for transportation at the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents more than 100,000 mechanics, baggage handlers and ramp workers at the major airlines.
