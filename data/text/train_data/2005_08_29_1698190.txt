TALK about making up for lost time. Almost eight years after its last advertising campaign, New York magazine plans to start one that will change contents almost every day.
The centerpiece of the campaign, which carries the theme ''This is New York,'' will be posters at five subway stations in Manhattan that are to be replaced each weekday. (The poster pasters will get a break on weekends.) The stations are Columbus Circle, 42nd Street-Times Square, Pennsylvania Station-34th Street, 68th Street and Spring Street.
