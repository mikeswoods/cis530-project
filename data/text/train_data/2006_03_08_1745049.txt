Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is expected to announce on Wednesday several new agreements to distribute movies made by other producers, according to several people apprised of the announcement.
Under the agreements, they said, MGM will distribute movies made by the Weinstein Company, founded by Bob and Harvey Weinstein; Bauer Martinez Entertainment, a producer of little-known fare like ''Modigliani''; and Lakeshore Entertainment, which recently had hits with ''Underworld: Evolution'' and ''The Exorcism of Emily Rose.''
