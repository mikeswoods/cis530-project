Rupert Murdoch won a crucial round yesterday in his continuing joust with John C. Malone when shareholders of the News Corporation approved a poison pill takeover defense that will help Mr. Murdoch keep his rival at bay.
The vote could also improve Mr. Murdoch's leverage in talks over sending News Corporation's controlling stake in DirecTV, the satellite television service, to Mr. Malone's Liberty Media Corporation in exchange for Liberty's 19 percent holding of News Corporation's voting shares.
