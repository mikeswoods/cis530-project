In a move that will create one of the nation's largest independent oil companies, Anadarko Petroleum said yesterday that it had agreed to buy two smaller rivals for $21.1 billion in cash to expand its operations into North America's fastest-growing oil and gas regions.
In separate deals, Anadarko will purchase Kerr-McGee for $16.4 billion and Western Gas Resources for $4.7 billion. Those prices represent considerable premiums over the companies' market value, based on closing stock prices Thursday: 40 percent for Kerr-McGee and 49 percent for Western Gas.
