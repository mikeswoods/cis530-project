A week from tonight, viewers of the ''NBC Nightly News With Brian Williams'' will be able to watch more news -- and fewer commercials -- as a result of a sponsorship deal with the Philips Electronics North America Corporation.
The sponsorship is part of a weeklong, $2 million agreement between Philips and the NBC Universal division of General Electric that includes ''Today,'' two cable shows and a feature on NBC's digital weather channel. The deal is the latest element in a campaign that seeks to drive home the Philips advertising theme ''sense and simplicity.''
