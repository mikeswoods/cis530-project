Roche Holding reported a 14 percent surge in its first-quarter revenues on Tuesday, driven by its cancer treatment, Avastin, and by government stockpiling of its bird flu vaccine, Tamiflu.
Group sales rose to 8.09 billion Swiss francs ($6.8 billion), of which Roche's pharmaceutical division contributed 6.16 billion Swiss francs ($5.1 billion), a jump of 18 percent, the company said. Roche, based in Basel, Switzerland, releases earnings figures only twice a year. The company said that drug sales this year would likely exceed a previous growth target of 10 percent, given the strong first-quarter figures. Profit margin may surpass the 25.7 percent achieved in 2004, the company said.
