THE founder and first C.E.O. of Scholastic was my father, Robbie. He'd developed a love of magazines at Dartmouth. When he graduated, he noticed that post-World War I America had a dramatic increase in high school enrollment, so he said, ''This might be where I can do a magazine.''
In those days, magazines were like the Internet today -- a new, national means of communication. After a couple of false starts he created a national magazine of contemporary issues and English literature for high school kids. He spent years and years going to English teachers' conventions and got to where he had six or seven magazines for different interests. Then he started a book club for bringing paperbacks into the schools.
