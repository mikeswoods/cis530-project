Two employees accused the Marubeni America Corporation, a subsidiary of the Marubeni Corporation of Japan, of employment discrimination, failure to pay overtime and accounting fraud in a civil complaint filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
The two employees, Kevin Long, senior vice president and general manager for human resources, and Ludvic Presto, senior vice president and general manager of the audit team, were both placed on paid administrative leave from the company last month. They are asking the court to find severance agreements -- which call for payment of more than $4 million to each plaintiff -- valid and enforceable. They also seek additional money damages and an order that Marubeni America cease to discriminate in its treatment of employees.
