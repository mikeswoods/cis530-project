When the iPod Photo was released last year, it had one shortcoming: it could not display photos loaded directly from a camera.
Now Apple offers a $29 accessory that allows photos to be displayed on the iPod Photo without a trip through a computer. The iPod Camera Connector plugs into the data slot on the bottom of the iPod and links to many digital cameras and memory card readers through a U.S.B. cable. (A list of compatible cameras can be found by clicking on the camera connector link at www.apple.com/ipodphoto/accessories.html.)
