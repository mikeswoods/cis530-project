A former broker with First Command Financial Planning, a brokerage firm that specialized in selling investments to military personnel, was fined $25,000 and suspended for 10 months for recommending unsuitable investment strategies to clients, NASD announced yesterday.
NASD, formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers, said that the former broker, Louis E. Stough, had recommended to 12 customers that they liquidate shares of mutual funds and reinvest the proceeds in ways that gave him large commissions but cost them substantially more than was necessary.
