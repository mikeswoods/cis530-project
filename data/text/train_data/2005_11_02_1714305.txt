ATA Airlines, once the busiest carrier in Indianapolis but shrinking during bankruptcy proceedings in the last year, said yesterday that it would cancel its last three daily flights out of the city, which is its headquarters, as of Jan. 10.
The move, however, is not expected to disrupt travel into and out of Indianapolis, which has continued to experience strong growth at its airport and has had little trouble attracting other carriers, notably Northwest Airlines, to take up the slack left by ATA, a subsidiary of ATA Holdings.
