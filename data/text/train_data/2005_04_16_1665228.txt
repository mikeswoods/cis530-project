The Raytheon Company offered yesterday to pay $12 million to settle an investigation into its accounting practices by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and said it had reached an agreement to pay $39 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by shareholders over a sale of assets in 2000.
The settlement, which is subject to S.E.C. approval, would resolve an inquiry into practices at Raytheon's commuter aircraft division from 1997-2001.
