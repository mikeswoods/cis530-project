''Wall Street Week,'' which became one of the most-watched programs on public television over 35 years, has been canceled. Maryland Public Television, the program's producer, and PBS, which distributes it to member stations, plan to announce today that the program will be broadcast for the last time on June 24.
The cancellation comes three years after the program's creator and longtime host, Louis Rukeyser, was removed as part of an effort to attract a bigger, younger audience.
