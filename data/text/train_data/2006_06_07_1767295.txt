A landmark former Ford assembly plant here that was designed by the renowned architect Albert Kahn is welcoming its first tenant since the late 1980's. The project is expected to give a boost to the beleaguered economy of this city of about 100,000 people at the north end of San Francisco Bay.
The 517,000-square-foot building, which is on the waterfront, is being renovated by the Orton Development Company of Emeryville, Calif. The first phase of the project, covering almost half the facility, is offering warehouse and assembly space. Later phases will be divided among office, retail, restaurant, conference and residential uses. The final configuration will be determined by demand as time passes.
