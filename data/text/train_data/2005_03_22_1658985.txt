Medicis Pharmaceutical, which makes prescription treatments for people who cannot stand their wrinkles, has agreed to acquire Inamed, a rival better known as the market leader in breast implants for women. The deal, for stock and cash, is valued at $2.8 billion.
The two companies told analysts in a conference call yesterday that they expected the deal to create an ''aesthetics powerhouse'' able to meet expanding demand for products to preserve a youthful appearance.
