The Securities and Exchange Commission, stepping up its efforts to stop penny-stock fraud in its tracks, has begun suspending suspicious trading that agency officials think could be a prelude to a market manipulation.
The S.E.C. halted trading in Courtside Products, a manufacturer of gym bags, on Friday, and in Commanche Properties, an entertainment company, on Monday. The securities for both companies, which are listed on the over-the-counter pink sheets, are restricted under S.E.C. rules and are ineligible for general trading for one year. As a result, even though only 2,200 shares of Commanche stock had changed hands, the trading raised a red flag.
