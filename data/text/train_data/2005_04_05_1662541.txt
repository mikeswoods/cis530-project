With its sales flat and its profits under pressure, Pfizer will announce plans to trim its spending at a meeting today with investors, drug industry analysts say.
But investors and analysts have given up their earlier hopes that Pfizer, the world's largest drug company, will announce broad cuts in its sales force or research spending, even though some of its biggest-selling drugs will soon face competition from low-priced generics. As a result, the meeting has generated little enthusiasm from investors, and Pfizer's shares closed yesterday near a five-year low.
