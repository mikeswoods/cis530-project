When Henry the cat began dragging his legs, his owner, Carol Kalinoski, suspected her 15-year-old pet's problem might be more serious than old age and arthritis.
Steroids weren't helping, so her veterinarian suggested that they do a magnetic resonance imaging exam on his lower spine. The cost was $1,200. Ms. Kalinoski paid. The vet didn't learn enough from that and he advised Ms. Kalinoski of Alexandria, Va., to get a second M.R.I. at the nearby imaging center run by Iams, the pet food unit of Procter & Gamble. Imaging the entire spine would cost another $1,200, and Ms. Kalinoski paid again.
