General Motors said yesterday that it would stop advertising in The Los Angeles Times ''until further notice.'' A G.M. spokeswoman characterized the decision as the culmination of a long-running dispute between the automaker and the newspaper over how G.M. is portrayed.
''It involves news reporting, it involves opinion. It's pretty broad-based, and we've made our objections well known to The Times,'' the G.M. spokeswoman, Ryndee Carney, said.
