I GREW up on a cattle ranch in Oklahoma, where people are rugged and self-sufficient. It was a sparsely populated area and the living conditions could be harsh. I always wanted to do things where I had a great deal of independence.
Every year there was a rattlesnake demonstration for the tourists. The organizers would pay the local residents 50 cents a pound to round up the snakes. When I was a freshman in college, a friend and I skipped classes and hunted diamondback rattlesnakes for two days. We caught 90 of them, which was quite a bit of beer money.
