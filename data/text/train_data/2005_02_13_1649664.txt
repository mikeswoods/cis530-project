FOR years, Armstrong Williams, co-founder of Graham Williams Group, a public relations agency in Washington, has catered to clients in politics, business and entertainment. His partner at the agency is Stedman Graham, the boyfriend of Oprah Winfrey. Mr. Williams is also a popular and ubiquitous political commentator, advocating individual accountability and ethical rectitude as a leading African-American conservative.
One of the Web sites of this P.R.-specialist-cum-commentator captures the flavor of his professional portfolio: ''Williams has become a multimedia wonder, taking stands for what's right on radio and television, in print and in cyberspace. Focusing on issues such as the work ethic, personal responsibility and especially the restoration of morality in today's society, Williams brings an independent view with a refreshing twist to the central issues of our day.''
