SIRIUS SATELLITE RADIO is joining the growing ranks of media outlets that accept liquor advertising, as it begins running musical commercials for Tanqueray gin.
The commercials consist of a hip-hop song titled ''Get Your Ice On,'' which can also be heard on several Web sites sponsored by Tanqueray. The spots, at two and a half minutes long, are running on Sirius channels like Cracked Up Comedy, Maxim Radio, OutQ Radio and Sports Byline.
