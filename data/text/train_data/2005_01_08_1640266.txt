The Food and Drug Administration has approved a new form of the widely used cancer drug Taxol that is easier to administer and avoids some side effects.
The new drug, Abraxane, was approved for women with advanced breast cancer who have not responded to chemotherapy, the drug's marketer, American Pharmaceutical Partners, announced late yesterday. An F.D.A. spokeswoman confirmed the approval but had no other comment.
