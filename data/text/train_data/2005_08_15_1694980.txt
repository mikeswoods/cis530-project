Agilent Technologies plans to announce a major reorganization today, including the sale of its semiconductor business, a spinoff of its chip testing unit and a major share buyback program, executives close to the company said.
Over the weekend, Agilent, which was spun off from Hewlett-Packard in 1999, was working out the details of an agreement to sell the semiconductor business to two private equity firms, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Silver Lake Partners, for about $2.66 billion, the executives said.
