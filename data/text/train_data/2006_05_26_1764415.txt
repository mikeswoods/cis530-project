Britain announced far-reaching plans to overhaul its cumbersome state pension system on Thursday, matching a trend in other advanced economies toward later retirement as people live longer and fewer young people enter the work force. The proposals, part of a broader European response to a pension time bomb, were the most ambitious in 60 years.
The plans, announced by the secretary for work and pensions, John Hutton, would re-establish a link between pensions and earnings scrapped by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 26 years ago and introduce a national pension savings program that would automatically enroll workers.
