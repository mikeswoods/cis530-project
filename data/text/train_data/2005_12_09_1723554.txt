Electronic Arts, the video game publisher, said on Thursday that it had reached a $680 million deal to acquire Jamdat Mobile, which makes games to be played on mobile phones.
The purchase, the largest ever by Electronic Arts, signifies an aggressive move into the relatively new mobile-game business. Some analysts say the category will boom as handsets become more sophisticated and allow for more elaborate graphics and intricate games, and as consumers become more comfortable with the mobile device as an entertainment platform.
