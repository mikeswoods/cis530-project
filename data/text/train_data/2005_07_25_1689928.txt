In a sign that the private equity firms that have dominated European deal making in recent years are beginning to be squeezed out, France Télécom is expected to win a 10 billion-euro or $12 billion fight for the Spanish mobile company Amena.
France Télécom's cash and stock purchase of Amena could be announced this week, possibly as soon as Tuesday, several executives involved in the negotiations said. Monday is a holiday in Spain.
