Lots of people call Wilbur L. Ross Jr. a vulture investor. He finds that ridiculous. If one must liken him to a bird, he says, then make it the phoenix, the mythical creature that repeatedly rises from its own ashes.
''Vultures pick off the flesh and leave the carcass to rot,'' he said, during a conversation in the Manhattan offices of W.L. Ross & Company, his investment firm. ''We help dying companies survive and grow.''
