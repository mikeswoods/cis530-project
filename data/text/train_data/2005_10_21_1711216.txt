The emerging technique of using stents to open carotid arteries in the neck can be successfully performed by even doctors with limited experience in the procedure, if they receive training, according to preliminary results of a federally mandated study released Thursday.
That finding, as well as results reported on Wednesday from a separate study of carotid stents, could encourage regulators to expand Medicare coverage for the procedure, according to doctors involved in the studies. The federal government has estimated that as many as 200,000 Americans undergo carotid-clearing surgery each year. Regulators approved marketing the stents to a high-risk group that could include as many as 25 percent of those people, but Medicare is covering fewer than 10 percent of them.
