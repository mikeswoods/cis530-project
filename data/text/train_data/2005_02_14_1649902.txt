The scene at Il Cantile restaurant in Little Italy in Manhattan last Thursday night was anything but old country. Electronic Arts used the restaurant to preview its new video game, The Godfather, which puts the player in the overcoat and homburg of a young operative in the Corleone organization, made famous in Mario Puzo's 1969 book and the 1972 movie it spawned.
Electronic Arts' version of the story was also a final collaboration for many of the original Godfather performers. James Caan and Robert Duvall reprised several of their famous conversations from the movie and added new dialogue written specifically for the game.
