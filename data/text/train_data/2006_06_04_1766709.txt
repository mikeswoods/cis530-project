For every two shares of its newly traded stock that MasterCard has given to its chief executive, Robert W. Selander, it gave about three to the company's rank and file. The entire rank and file.
MasterCard, which went public on May 25 with a $2.4 billion stock sale, disclosed last week that Mr. Selander received 287,341 shares of restricted stock on the day of the offering. Each of the company's 4,400 employees received 100 shares that will vest in three years -- if they are still working for MasterCard then.
