Dell, which built its business selling PC's and other electronics directly to customers by phone and online, has decided to try something new: a storefront.
Dell said yesterday that it would open two mall stores this summer as a test, making them a hybrid of Dell's direct model and a conventional electronics store. Dell's products will be on display, but customers will order a PC, television or printer online from the store. Products will be delivered to the customer as if they had ordered from a PC at home, as most of its customers do.
