Even after Saturday's bombings, which killed 22 people on the Indonesian island of Bali, analysts say it is harder to terrorize Southeast Asia and the tourists who visit the region than it once was.
The attacks are likely to have an immediate impact on Bali's tourism, analysts predicted. But Indonesia is likely to bounce back sooner than it did after the much deadlier attacks there in 2002. The latest attacks are also unlikely to damage the regional economy as much as the 2002 bombing, which killed 202 people, they said.
