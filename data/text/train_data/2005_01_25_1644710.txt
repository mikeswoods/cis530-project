Krispy Kreme Doughnuts said yesterday that it had agreed to pay its two new top officers hourly rates of $760 and $695, as well as paying a possible bonus it they succeed in turning around the financially troubled company.
But the company did not say whether it had secured a further extension from bank lenders who could declare the company in default on its loans, threatening a bankruptcy protection filing.
