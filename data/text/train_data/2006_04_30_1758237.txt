AS the only business columnist I know who was once a doorman, I couldn't read about the last-minute contract agreement for New York's apartment-building workers without thinking about the guillotine.
It's not that my experience -- three summers at the portal of a classy old pile on 69th and Lexington -- turned me into a revolutionary. Quite the contrary, those summers gave me the wherewithal to grab a low spot on the totem pole of bourgeois life, a spot to which I have clung desperately ever since.
