The A.F.L.-C.I.O. filed a trade complaint on Thursday asking President Bush to penalize China, asserting that it violates workers' rights by suppressing strikes, barring independent unions and letting factories ignore laws on minimum wages and child labor.
The complaint says that repression of workers' rights has enabled Chinese companies to push down labor costs by at least 47 percent, undercutting American companies and causing the loss of more than 400,000 factory jobs in the United States.
