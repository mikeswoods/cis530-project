After nearly a year of searching for a designer to take over Givenchy, the fabled French fashion house, LVMH MoÃ«t Hennessy Louis Vuitton announced yesterday that Riccardo Tisci, a relatively unknown designer, would become Givenchy's creative director for women's wear.
The appointment of Mr. Tisci was surprising because he does not have the name recognition of other LVMH designers like John Galliano, the designer of Christian Dior, or Marc Jacobs, who designs Vuitton.
