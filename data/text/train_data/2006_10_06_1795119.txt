Patricia C. Dunn, the former Hewlett-Packard chairwoman, made her first court appearance on Thursday after being charged in connection with a spying operation at the company.
Ms. Dunn, who surrendered voluntarily in exchange for the withdrawal of an arrest warrant against her, was booked on four felony charges at the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department. She agreed to return to court for an arraignment hearing on Nov. 17.
