GAS MONEY -- For weeks, airlines have been essentially asking passengers to chip in for gas by raising fares about $10 each way. Staggered by sharply rising fuel costs, the major airlines have managed to raise fares twice in the last month. And they are trying again. But it was not clear last night whether the latest attempt to add $10 to fares, begun last week by Continental Airlines and matched over the weekend by its competitors, was going to collapse. After Delta Air Lines retreated yesterday morning from the latest fare increase, Continental also abandoned it, according to The Associated Press. Competitors were assessing their positions last night. Still, with oil prices expected to remain at record levels, industry experts predict that fares will keep rising. ''Some leisure fares are now $50 more round-trip than they were Feb. 1,'' said Terry Trippler, an online air-fare analyst. ''I don't think this is the end of it. I think we're going to see more fare increases.''
FAST-GROWTH AIRPORTS -- The five airports where traffic will grow the most by 2010, and the reasons, according to the Boyd Group's latest forecast, are Sarasota-Bradenton, Fla. (34 percent growth, largely because of the entry of AirTran); Boston (32.7 percent, JetBlue expansion); Fort Myers, Fla. (27.6 percent, strong regional population growth); Phoenix (24 percent, strong regional population growth, assuming adequate water supply continues); and Atlanta (24 percent, increased competition with Delta Air Lines by other carriers moving in).
