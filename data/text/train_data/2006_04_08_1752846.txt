ONE of the great puzzles of human nature is why humans strive for more material things -- money, jobs, homes, cars, flat-screen televisions -- when they do not seem to make them any happier in the long run.
Philosophers have pondered this conundrum for centuries, and modern economists have been examining it over several decades in a multitude of cultures. Not only does greater wealth not guarantee happiness -- even when you get what you want -- research indicates that you will not find it as satisfying as you had hoped, and you will want something else.
