David Bradford, an influential tax economist who devised an innovative way to change the income-tax system to encourage people to save and invest more, died on Tuesday in Philadelphia. He was 66 and lived in Princeton, N.J.
The cause was burns he suffered after a Christmas tree caught fire in his home on Feb. 8, his son, Theodore, said.
