A federal jury found yesterday that Wal-Mart Stores had discriminated against a disabled Long Island man who briefly held a job at the company's Centereach, N.Y., store, and ordered the company to pay him $7.5 million in damages.
The plaintiff, Patrick Brady, 21 years old, has cerebral palsy. He applied for a job in the Wal-Mart pharmacy department in the summer of 2002 and was hired. He said he quit not long after he was reassigned to other responsibilities, including collecting garbage and shopping carts from the parking lot.
