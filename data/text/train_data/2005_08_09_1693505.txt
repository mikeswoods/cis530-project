The Whirlpool Corporation yesterday raised its bid for the Maytag Corporation, its competitor in the appliance market, to $1.62 billion in cash and stock.
The offer, which works out to $20 a share, tops both Whirlpool's most recent $18-a-share proposal and the all-cash bid of $14 a share that Maytag originally accepted from an investment group led by Ripplewood Holdings, the private equity firm. Whirlpool had until today to raise its offer.
