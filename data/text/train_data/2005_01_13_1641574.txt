In separate closing arguments yesterday, lawyers for Anthony Elgindy and Jeffrey A. Royer tried to chip away at prosecutors' accusations that the two men worked together in an elaborate securities fraud.
Mr. Elgindy, a controversial stock adviser, and Mr. Royer, a former F.B.I. agent, are at the center of a complex fraud case that has played out in Federal District Court in Brooklyn over the last nine weeks. Mr. Royer is accused of providing Mr. Elgindy and his associates with confidential information about investigations of companies, and Mr. Elgindy is charged with using that information to profit when those companies' stocks fell.
