Comcast plans to offer Internet-based phone service in 20 of its markets by the end of the year as it works to catch up to its competitors, including Time Warner Cable and Cablevision, which already offer the service.
Comcast, the nation's biggest cable provider with 21 million subscribers, will make Internet phone service available to all its customers by the end of 2006, according to the company's chief executive, Brian L. Roberts, who spoke at an investor conference. The company expects to sign up eight million subscribers for the service by 2010.
