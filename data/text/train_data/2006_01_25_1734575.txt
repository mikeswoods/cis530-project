After repeated efforts to thwart a hostile takeover bid from Arcelor, the board of the Canadian steel maker Dofasco endorsed the company's offer of 71 Canadian dollars a share early Tuesday.
The move followed a decision by ThyssenKrupp of Germany, Dofasco's suitor of choice, not to match or better Arcelor's offer, which values Dofasco around 5.5 billion Canadian dollars ($4.78 billion).
