THE Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is the American Psychiatric Association's bible for defining hundreds of behaviors deemed to be abnormal enough to be described as mental diseases. One of my favorites is ''dissociative fugue,'' which, says the manual, has as its essential feature ''sudden unexpected travel away from home or one's customary place of daily activities.''
Still, since the manual, now in its fourth edition, is revised every so often, I'm going to suggest an admittedly frivolous new subcategory with dissociative fugue for the next edition: ''mileage-run-induced frequent-flier fugue.''
