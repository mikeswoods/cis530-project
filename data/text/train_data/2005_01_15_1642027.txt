In a final attempt to refute the claims of the two defendants, prosecutors argued yesterday that there was ''overwhelming evidence'' that the two, Anthony Elgindy and Jeffrey A. Royer, were working together to commit securities fraud and not to expose corporate crime.
Mr. Elgindy, a controversial Internet stock trader, is accused of receiving confidential government information from Mr. Royer, a former F.B.I. agent, and using it in an elaborate stock-selling scheme.
