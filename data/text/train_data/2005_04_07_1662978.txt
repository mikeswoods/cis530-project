Investigators have learned that two offshore insurers that appeared to have no affiliation with American International Group were secretly backed by the global insurance giant through complex agreements, according to people who were briefed on the matter.
An A.I.G. affiliate secretly guaranteed the investments that other companies made in the offshore insurers, effectively making those insurers' operations part of A.I.G., according to the people.
