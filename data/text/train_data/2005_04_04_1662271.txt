AN Australian who opened a boutique creative agency in China and found fast success in Asia before expanding to Europe is now hoping to persuade Americans to buy more chocolate snacks from Mars.
The game of advertising geography being played by the Australian, Chris Clarke, and his agency, Nitro, is indicative of a trend that is rapidly remaking Madison Avenue. Giant marketers like Mars, Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola and Unilever are increasingly bypassing their giant agencies to award assignments to smaller, presumably nimbler, independent shops that specialize in nontraditional creative ideas.
