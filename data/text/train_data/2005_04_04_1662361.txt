Creative teams that helped produce some of the best-liked, most-discussed commercials in Super Bowl XXXIX in February have left their agencies for Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group.
One creative team is leaving the Los Angeles office of DDB Worldwide, also part of Omnicom, where it worked on humorous commercials for Ameriquest Mortgage suggesting that things are not always what they seem to be. The copywriter, Pat McKay, and the art director, Feh Tarty, will have the same titles at Goodby, Silverstein.
