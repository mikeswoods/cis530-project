I GOT kicked out of school at 17 because I got my girlfriend pregnant. I grew up in Lancaster, a working-class city in the northwest of England. Her school allowed her to stay, but my school said I couldn't. I never went back to school.
Being at the Lancaster Royal Grammar School, however, had been a turning point in my life. It is one of the finest private schools in England, and I had gotten a scholarship at age 11 because I was a strong athlete. It was the first time I had met kids who were not from the same environment. My father was a security guard and my mother worked in a shop. These kids were from middle-class backgrounds.
