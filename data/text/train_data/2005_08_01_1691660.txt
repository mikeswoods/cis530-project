Medtronic said yesterday that it had received its long-awaited clearance from European regulators to market its drug-coated Endeavor heart stent.
The approval opens the door for Medtronic to compete with Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson in one of the medical device industry's largest and most lucrative markets. It also clears the way for Medtronic to begin marketing Endeavor in many other countries that follow Europe's regulatory lead on medical devices, including Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, Mexico and several Persian Gulf nations.
