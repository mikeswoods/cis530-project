Sun Microsystems is set to announce the first of a new generation of processors for computer servers on Monday that the company says offers faster performance with far less energy use.
Sun Microsystems, once a high flier in Silicon Valley, hopes that the new chip, called the UltraSparc T1, will help it win back the market share it lost to higher-performing yet less expensive Unix servers the last few years.
