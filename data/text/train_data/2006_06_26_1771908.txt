For those who argue that young people are spending too much time in front of computers, MTV Networks has an answer. It will now let them feed and dote on virtual pets using cellphones.
MTV, a unit of Viacom, plans to introduce a cellphone-based version of its popular Neopets Web site tomorrow. The site (www.neopets.com), which MTV bought a year ago for $160 million, lets users adopt, feed and nurture their pets and do battle with cartoonish creatures including the catlike Aisha and the dragonlike Scorchio.
