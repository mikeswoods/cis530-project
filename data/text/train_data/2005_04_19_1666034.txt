THE city that wants to be known as ''the world's second home,'' to quote a trademark application recently filed by the Bloomberg administration, is about to be inundated by a marketing blitz from a company that promotes itself as ''the world's local bank.''
The HSBC Bank USA unit of HSBC Holdings is mounting an elaborate campaign, with a budget estimated at $10 million to $15 million, meant to stimulate business in the increasingly competitive New York market. The campaign is the first major new effort for HSBC in the United States since JWT and other agencies owned by the WPP Group were named last May to handle the bank's worldwide account, with spending estimated at $600 million.
