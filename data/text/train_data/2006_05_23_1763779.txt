YOU can't fix stupid, as the comedian Ron White says. Which is the reason I long ago gave up on engaging with rage-addled drivers, including the belligerent fruitcakes who run up on your bumper at 65 miles an hour.
There are just too many idiots out there licensed to operate potentially dangerous equipment (cars), and too many states (about three dozen, but who's counting?) where it's legal to carry concealed firearms. I don't like those odds. I went to Vietnam in early 1968 and nobody shot me, despite clear motive. I'd sure hate to end up whacked on Interstate 95 just because I forgot to turn off my blinker.
