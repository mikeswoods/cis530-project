QUESTION: Is a fast-growing economy good news or bad? Answer: Normally good, of course, but not always -- at least not if robust growth encourages the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates.
That, at least, was the collective conclusion of the stock market last week. The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 96 points in the minutes after the Fed released its latest rate decision. Investors' moods were not helped by the prospect of a potentially damaging labor-management showdown in the auto industry.
