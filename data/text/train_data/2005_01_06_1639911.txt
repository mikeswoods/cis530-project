The private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners is delving deeper into the talent management business, providing the financing for a deal that unites two of the music industry's best-known artist representatives, according to music executives involved in the discussions.
As part of the deal, the talent managers, Irving Azoff and Howard Kaufman, will create a new Front Line Management, a company with a roster of clients that includes the Eagles, Christina Aguilera and Jimmy Buffett. With the Lee investment, whose terms have not been disclosed, the managers are looking to expand by adding a number of other artist representatives.
