The Russian oligarch Aleksei Mordashov lost the battle for the steel company Arcelor for one reason, Russian politicians say: Russophobia, or a bias against Russian businesses and businessmen.
Mr. Mordashov, the 40-year-old billionaire and chief executive of Severstal,  was bumped aside on Sunday, after Arcelor's board accepted a 26 billion euro ($33 billion) takeover from Mittal Steel, saying it was the more valuable offer. Mr. Mordashov was offering assets he said were worth 8 billion euros for a quarter of Arcelor. His offer seemed to be unpopular with some Arcelor investors, who seemed to worry that he would gain control of the whole company. The reaction in Russia to the news was swift and angry.
