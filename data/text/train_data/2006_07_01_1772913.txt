I WENT looking for a timepiece and a measure of redemption, only to be sucked back down to Chinatown on the next to last day of spring. It was half-past noon, and the sidewalks were teeming with sweaty street vendors and sweatier tourists. The air reeked of cheap perfume, cheaper soap and the take-out lunches of roast duck, pork fried rice and garlic-slathered noodles the shopkeepers were eating at their counters.
I climbed out of a subway hole, looking and feeling like a loser. And I was a loser. Not just any old loser. I was a loser of fine watches, sunburned and bare-wristed, clutching a dog-eared copy of ''The Myth of Sisyphus'' like a flattened aluminum can. The street vendors immediately got my number.
