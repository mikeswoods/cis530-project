Ten current or retired corporate executives -- none of them Donald J. Trump  -- have publicly told Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld: ''You're fired!'' Or, at least, he would be fired if he worked for any one of them.
The executives listed their bill of particulars against Mr. Rumsfeld -- himself a former C.E.O., of the drug maker G. D. Searle & Company -- in a full-page ad published in The New York Times and paid for by Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, a liberal advocacy group.
