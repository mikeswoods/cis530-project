The stock market surged to its biggest weekly gains in months last week on optimism that the Federal Reserve had nearly finished tightening interest rates.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.2 percent on Thursday, its biggest daily gain in three years. Federal Reserve policy makers on Thursday raised short-term rates for a 17th consecutive time. But a statement released after their meeting said that further rate increases depended ''on the outlook for inflation and economic growth,'' signaling, perhaps, that the central bank might not increase rates again at its next meeting.
