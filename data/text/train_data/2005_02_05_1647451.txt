Despite a solid earnings report and a rising stock market, shares of Time Warner fell 12 cents, to close at $18.04 yesterday. Several analysts and investors attributed the decline to concerns that the Time Warner bid for Adelphia Communications would commit it further to an industry where growth could be slowing.
The company said yesterday that its revenue for the fourth quarter rose 1.8 percent, to $11.1 billion, and that net income jumped 77 percent, to $1.1 billion, or 24 cents a share, compared with $639 million, or 14 cents a share, for the similar quarter in 2003.
