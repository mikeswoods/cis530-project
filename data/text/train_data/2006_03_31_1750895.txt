Like many women, my experience shopping for pants is often an exercise in futility.
It goes something like this. I enter the dressing room full of hope with a stash of pants that look really cute, hip and flattering on the hanger. But after 15 minutes of yanking and zipping, I return the whole pile of ill-fitting clothing, and leave the store annoyed and empty handed.
