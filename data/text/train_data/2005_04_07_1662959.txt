Michael Roberts, a restaurateur and chef whose playful and astonishingly successful marriages of preposterous ingredients helped forge the California culinary revolution of the 1980's, died on March 30 at his home in South Philadelphia, where he had lived for the last several years. He was 55.
The cause was complications of Kugelberg-Welander syndrome, a degenerative neuromuscular disorder, his brother, Clifford, said.
