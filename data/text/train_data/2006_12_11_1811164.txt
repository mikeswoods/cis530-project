The European medical products manufacturer Smith & Nephew is expected to bid about Â£6 billion, or more than $11 billion, for the medical device maker Biomet this week, according to several executives involved in the sale.
There is no guarantee a deal will be reached. The London-based Biomet, which specializes in joint-replacement devices and is based in Warsaw, Ind., could also attract other offers, including private equity bids, analysts said.
