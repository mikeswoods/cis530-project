JACK J. BRENNAN, chairman and chief executive of the Vanguard Group, is saying, as he has many times before, that his company isn't trying to become bigger. As Mr. Brennan speaks, he chops the air with his open hand for emphasis. ''We've never had a growth objective,'' he says. ''Ever. And we never will. Vanguard's goal is to deliver value to the client. How big we are is irrelevant.''
Not pursuing bigness for its own sake is a core tenet at the company, which is based in Malvern, Pa. Even so, Vanguard's assets under management swelled during 2004; it says that some $56.4 billion flowed into the company's stock and bond funds. Through December, Vanguard, which sells its funds directly to investors, had surpassed $815 billion in assets under management. That makes it the country's second-largest mutual fund company, behind Fidelity Investments in Boston, which manages $892 billion in mutual funds and an additional $134 billion in trust assets.
