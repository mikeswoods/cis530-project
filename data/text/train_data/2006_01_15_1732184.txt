I GREW up in Philadelphia and, although my family was Jewish, went to Friends' Central, a Quaker school, for 12 years. The values taught there had a big impact on me. I had classes with wealthy Main Line debutantes and kids from rough Philly neighborhoods, but there were no cliques or bullies. We learned about community and service, which encouraged us to be friends with everyone.
There was a weekly meeting for worship where we had to remain silent for an entire hour. But if students were moved to speak, they could stand up and do so. We were really learning meditation. When I was young, it was impossible not to be distracted, but as I got older I appreciated the time to become centered.
