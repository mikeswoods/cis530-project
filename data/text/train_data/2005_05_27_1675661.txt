In a deal that would create one of Europe's first big cross-border financial powerhouses, Unicredito Italiano and the HVB Group of Germany are discussing a merger, executives involved in the discussions said on Friday. The deal could be valued at 16 billion euros, or about $20 billion.
Any deal is far from guaranteed, one executive cautioned, and not expected to be announced before next week, if at all. The executive, however, characterized the talks as being in advanced stages.
