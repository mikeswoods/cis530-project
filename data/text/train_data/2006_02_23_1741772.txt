Skype, the program for making online phone calls, generally requires users to be tethered to a computer and an Internet connection. The VoSKY Call Center changes that equation, adding some interesting new options to the mix.
The Call Center, which costs $69.95 and is available at VoSKY's Web site, www.vosky.com, works with an Internet-connected Windows PC. When you attach an ordinary landline phone, you can use it to make calls to regular phones over the Internet at a reduced rate using the SkypeOut service, or make calls directly to other online Skype users, a free service.
