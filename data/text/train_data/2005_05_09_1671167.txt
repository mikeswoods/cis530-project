Robin Roberts, the news reader on ''Good Morning America'' on ABC since 2002, is getting new responsibilities on the program. The network is expected to announce today that she is being made a co-host of the program, which gives her a rank (and duties) equal to that of Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer, who have been the hosts since early 1999.
The promotion of Ms. Roberts was described yesterday by two people who had been briefed on it but who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose it.
