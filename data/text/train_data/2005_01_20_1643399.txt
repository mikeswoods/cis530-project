The Ketchum public relations agency has reversed course, apologizing for paying a company owned by the conservative commentator Armstrong Williams to promote the Bush administration's educational policies. The agency also promised to change its policies to prevent another such ''lapse in judgment.''
The apology, in a statement released Tuesday night, came after two weeks of criticism. The critics said Ketchum compromised industry ethical standards by not disclosing that it paid the Graham Williams Group $240,000 on behalf of a client, the Education Department, to have Mr. Williams praise the No Child Left Behind Act on his television show and in his newspaper column. Mr. Williams acknowledged the payments after they were disclosed by USA Today on Jan. 7.
