Long Island MacArthur Airport is about twice the size of La Guardia, but for decades it was a very sleepy place. Lately, however, thanks in large part to expansion undertaken by Southwest Airlines, it has become a much more vital economic force in Suffolk County.
In August, Southwest Airlines opened a new $51 million concourse at the airport, which is owned by the town of Islip. The 114,254-square-foot concourse was paid for entirely by Southwest. It has four passenger gates, replacing three gates that the airline had been using, as well as five restaurants, a bookstore and a newsstand.
