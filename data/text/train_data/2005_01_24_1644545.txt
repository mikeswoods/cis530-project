When top executives in broadcast radio recently banded together to promote their stations in the face of growing competition from satellite radio, they called on stars like Avril Lavigne and Ludacris to appear in advertisements. Not to be outdone, Sirius Satellite Radio countered by enlisting a music executive.
Sirius has struck an exclusive pact to sign Jimmy Iovine, chairman of Interscope Records, as a consultant and adviser in the development of programming and marketing arrangements. Scott Greenstein, the Sirius president for entertainment and sports, has begun discussing similar deals with other top music executives.
