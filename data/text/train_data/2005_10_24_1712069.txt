Weary of being scolded by parents and politicians, video game makers tend to play down the violent nature of certain games, but a gaming magazine is going out of its way to push the limits. To promote an article on the new Resident Evil 4, PSM, an unofficial PlayStation 2 magazine, inserted burlap bags as ''RE4 Halloween masks'' into 200,000 copies of its current issue.
A burlap bag, players of previous Resident Evil games know, conceals a chainsaw-wielding zombie. Accompanying instructions feature a photo of someone wearing the mask while gripping a bloody chainsaw-shaped control board that readers are eligible to win.
