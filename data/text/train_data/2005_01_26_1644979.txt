A New York State trial judge has ruled that a catalog sales company in Watertown, N.Y., near the Army base at Fort Drum, is actually a lender in disguise -- one that has been making illegal short-term loans to military and civilian customers at annual interest rates of more than 700 percent.
The ruling, by Justice Bernard J. Malone Jr. of State Supreme Court in Albany, came in response to a lawsuit filed in September by the office of the New York State attorney general, Eliot Spitzer. It prohibits the company, N.Y. Catalog Sales, from making any new loans and nullifies any outstanding loans, freeing the borrowers from any obligation to repay the principal or the interest.
