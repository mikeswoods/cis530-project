Among the people celebrating North Carolina's national championship in men's college basketball last week was Vaughn D. Bryson, the former chief executive of Eli Lilly -- and a former first baseman for the university's baseball team.
Mr. Bryson, along with his wife, Nancy, and their two grown children -- all North Carolina alumni -- were courtside in St. Louis for the N.C.A.A. championship game, in which North Carolina's Tar Heels beat Illinois, 75-70. ''This was so exciting, being there for the national championship,'' said Mr. Bryson, 66.
