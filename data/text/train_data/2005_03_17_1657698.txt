THE single-cell paramecium is about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. In many species, mature cells divide daily into two daughter cells. In schools around the world, this feature has made the paramecium a favorite vehicle for illustrating the miracle of compound interest.
Left unchecked for 64 days, a single paramecium would become a colony of 9,223,400,000,000,000,000 members. Since 125 paramecia lined up shoulder-to-shoulder would span about an inch, this means a string spanning more than 1,164,600,000,000 miles -- over 6,000 round trips between the Earth and sun.
