I GREW up an only child near Pensacola, Fla. My parents and grandparents treated me like an adult from an early age. I worked in our family's variety store, sweeping the floor, making Easter baskets and doing whatever else I was capable of. When I was 8, my father gave me a snow cone machine and I opened my own business.
I set up shop at the entrance of the store. Instead of investing in a syrup dispenser, which would have saved me money in the long run, I used squeezable ketchup bottles to pour the syrup. I couldn't justify spending $60 for a dispenser. When I was 9 or 10 I started a winter business, taking Polaroids of kids on Santa's knee on the first floor of the store.
