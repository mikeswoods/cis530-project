FOR more than a year I've been paying $4.95 a month for access to product reviews on the Consumer Reports Web site. I'm not an appliance junkie. I just happened to sign up when my husband and I were looking for a washer-dryer, and told myself: It's only $4.95 a month; I'll cancel as soon as we figure out what to buy.
Although we put that purchase off, I was reluctant to cancel and give up all those handy product ratings. What if we needed a blender? Switching to the annual subscriber rate of $26 would have saved money, but my own inertia worked against me. Soon the monthly fee blended into all the other charges on my credit card statement, and I forgot it was there. And kept paying it.
