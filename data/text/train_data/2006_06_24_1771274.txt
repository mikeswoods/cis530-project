The Luxembourg steel giant Arcelor is expected to announce a friendly deal to be acquired by Mittal Steel after its board meets Sunday, ending five months of hostility, several people involved in the negotiations said Friday.
Talks between the companies continued Friday in London and other cities in Europe, people involved said, and they could still fall apart. As of Friday evening, the two companies had not agreed on a price, but the deal could be worth about 26 billion euros ($32.8 billion), up from the previous offer of 24 billion euros at current market price.
