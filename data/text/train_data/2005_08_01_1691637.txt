How much does GQ magazine like the new movie ''The Dukes of Hazzard?'' Enough to feature two stars from the film on its cover in successive months. The July issue had Jessica Simpson, who plays Daisy Duke, and the August cover has Johnny Knoxville, who plays Luke Duke. The movie opens on Friday.
The magazine said that the two pictures were more coincidence than anything else. Jim Nelson, the editor in chief, explained that the cover with Mr. Knoxville is GQ's ''official 'Dukes of Hazzard' cover.'' The editors wanted Ms. Simpson for July's cover because they were doing a special issue on America and ''she was the perfect face for it.''
