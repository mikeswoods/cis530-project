The Goldman Sachs Group reported an 84 percent gain in third quarter earnings yesterday, driven by significant gains in stock and bond trading as well a surge in revenue for services offered to hedge funds.
''Everything went the right way,'' said David Viniar, chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs. ''It was a strong quarter across the board.''
