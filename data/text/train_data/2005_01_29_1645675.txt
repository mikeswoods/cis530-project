Mitsubishi Motors said Friday that it had secured 540 billion yen ($5.2 billion) in emergency financing from several sister companies in the latest of a string of multibillion-dollar bailouts for the struggling company.
The package comes less than eight months after the company received a $4.6 billion bailout that at the time was billed as its last chance for a turnaround. The company warned Friday that it expected a loss of $4.58 billion for the year ending in March, almost twice its previous estimate.
