The board of the Luxembourg steel giant Arcelor seems to be having a hard time deciding what to do next.
The company said Wednesday evening that the board would meet on Sunday to choose between two competing bids, one from Severstal of Russia and the other from Mittal Steel of London. The announcement came after a six-hour board meeting to discuss the two proposals.
