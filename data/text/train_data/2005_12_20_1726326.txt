China said on Tuesday that its economy, the fastest growing in the world, is larger than it had previously reported. The government reported this morning that its gross domestic product was nearly $2 trillion in 2004, not $1.6 trillion as it had previously reported, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
The nationwide survey suggests that China's economic growth is an even more influential factor in the global markets and that its people are even richer and consume more than previously estimated.
