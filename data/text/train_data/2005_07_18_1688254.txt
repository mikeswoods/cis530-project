In the summer blockbuster movie ''Mr. and Mrs. Smith,'' from 20th Century Fox, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie play godless suburbanites and professional assassins. But when they steal their neighbor's car for an extended chase scene, a crucifix hangs conspicuously from the rearview mirror, and in the next scene the actors wear borrowed jackets that read ''Jesus Rocks,'' as they go on the lam.
''We decided to make the next-door neighbor, whose crucifix it is, be hip, young, cool Christians,'' explained the movie's director, Doug Liman. ''It's literally in there for no other reason than I thought, This is cool.''
