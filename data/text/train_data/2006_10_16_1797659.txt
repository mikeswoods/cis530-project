Last Wednesday, I was working late but left the office in time to watch the second episode of ABC's ''Lost.'' But when I got home and booted the computer to check messages before hitting the couch, I happened to notice one of my twin daughters at a far-flung Big 10 campus was live on Yahoo! Messenger.
I clicked on ''View my Webcam,'' as did Erin, a freshman at the University of Wisconsin, and suddenly I had the chance to inspect the disturbingly large ring she recently had implanted in her lip. Live video may seem straight out of the Jetsons, but I have the computing skills of Fred Flintstone. Still, between my PC and my daughter's Mac, we managed to get a serviceable video chat going, assisted by speakerphones on cells.
