When the hedge fund Archeus Capital opened to investors in 2003, it did so with high hopes and a glittering trading pedigree. Its co-founder, Gary K. Kilberg, was one of the aggressive Salomon Brothers bond traders memorialized in ''Liar's Poker.''
By 2005, investors, enamored of its complex trading strategies, had poured $3 billion into the fund. Within a year, however, some bad bets and administrative troubles resulted in a spate of investor withdrawals and its funds shrank. Now, its assets are down to $682 million, several partners have left and its return for the year is a negative 1.9 percent, making Archeus the latest hedge fund to fall from its gilded perch.
