ACCORDING to Arianna Huffington, the use of banal, insipid language could spell doom for the Internet.
It is not badly written blogs Ms. Huffington is worried about, but the concept ''Net neutrality.'' Congress is debating whether to block Internet service providers from favoring some content providers over others. So, in theory, Time Warner or Verizon could prefer Yahoo over Google, or vice versa (or either of those over an upstart) by giving them more bandwidth in exchange for cash. The preferred sites would then run faster on PC's than those that do not pay.
