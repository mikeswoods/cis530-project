Martha Stewart returned in the early morning hours yesterday to one of her homes, a sprawling model farm in rural Westchester County. And there she found that not much had changed since she last roamed free, with reporters and photographers camped by the dozen in front of her house and the public keenly interested in every detail of her post-prison existence.
She passed around coffee and doughnuts to reporters gathered outside her property. And she strolled from building to building on the grounds, wearing a long winter-white coat and clearly displaying a happy mood, even waving to a helicopter hovering 1,000 feet overhead.
