Jim Kelly, who has been managing editor of Time magazine for more than five years and last week accepted Time's national magazine award for general excellence, is moving upstairs in the Time-Life hierarchy to the newly created position of managing editor for Time Inc., the company announced yesterday.
His successor, who will become the 16th managing editor in the magazine's 83-year history, is to be announced later this week. The person was said by one Time executive to have ''great E.Q. and great I.Q.,'' meaning the candidate ''is both a first-class intellect and has a first-class temperament.''
