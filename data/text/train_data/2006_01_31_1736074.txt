After rejecting a partial takeover bid from Carl C. Icahn, Fairmont Hotels and Resorts endorsed a $3.9 billion cash offer Monday from Kingdom Hotels International, which is controlled by Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a Saudi businessman and member of the Saudi royal family, and Colony Capital, an investment firm.
If the bid is successful, Fairmont's luxury hotel operation will be merged with Raffles Hotels and Resorts, another high-end brand that is owned by Colony.
