The European Union and Canada said Thursday that they would impose trade sanctions on a variety of American goods in retaliation for a tax system that compensates American manufacturers deemed to have been hurt by foreign goods sold below cost.
Beginning May 1, the European Commission and Canada will raise import duties 15 percent on a range of American products. In Europe, pocket diaries, women's trousers and frozen sweet corn are among the $28 million in exports that will be taxed more heavily. Canada will impose the duty on some $11.5 million in American exports of cigarettes, pigs, oysters and specialty fish.
