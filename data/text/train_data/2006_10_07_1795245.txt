I STEPPED into a simulated sidewalk mugging between nasty-looking guys, each of whom outweighed me by over 40 pounds. The only way I knew how to defend myself was by mimicking the comedian Jack Benny. I placed the palm of my left hand on my chin, and cupped my right hand underneath my left elbow, affecting a look of meekness.
Then the lights went out. The guy on the left went for me, and I went wild. I stabbed my left hand at his throat, karate-chop style. I jabbed my right hand at his face, palm open, fingers clawing for his eyes. I jerked my right knee toward his groin, screaming at the top of my lungs.
