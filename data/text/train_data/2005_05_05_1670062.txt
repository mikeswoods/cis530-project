The United States attorney in Boston is investigating Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund giant, as well as a number of Wall Street banks to determine whether the banks' brokers plied Fidelity traders with lavish gifts and decadent entertainment to try to win some of Fidelity's lucrative trading business, said two people involved in the investigation.
Federal prosecutors in Boston became interested in an inquiry begun in November by the Securities and Exchange Commission and NASD, when it became clear that ''sex and drugs'' were among the enticements offered to traders, the two people said.
