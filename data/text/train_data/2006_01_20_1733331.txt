New housing starts fell sharply in December and building permits fell to their lowest level since May, the government reported yesterday, reflecting a slowing in the housing market from a peak last summer.
The Commerce Department said the number of homes that builders began constructing last month fell 8.9 percent, to an annual pace of 1.93 million. The number of permits issued dropped 4.4 percent, to a pace of 2.07 million.
