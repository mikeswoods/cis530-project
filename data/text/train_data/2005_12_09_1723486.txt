THE new agency for the Mini Cooper is just the type that is remaking the way marketers approach advertising: smaller, creatively focused, independent and knowledgeable enough about technology to develop some unusual new ways to reach consumers.
The agency is Butler, Shine, Stern & Partners in Sausalito, Calif., which Mini USA named yesterday to take over the Mini Cooper account. Mini USA spends about $40 million a year on ads for the Mini Cooper line of subcompact coupes and sedans.
