The Intel Corporation, the largest semiconductor maker, is expected to unveil on Monday its first server processors that place multiple microprocessors on a single piece of silicon, stepping up its efforts to compete head-to-head with Advanced Micro Devices, which introduced its first dual-core server chip in the spring.
Intel has been developing the new Xeon processors under the code-name Paxville. The dual-core chip technology used in the servers effectively speeds performance while preventing the overheating that can plague high-performing processors. Also on Monday, the company will introduce a multicore version, putting four microprocessors on one piece of silicon.
