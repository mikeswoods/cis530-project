ONE vivid memory is my mother ironing. My father was a janitor and my mother was a maid. And she would take in laundry to iron. I remember being impressed at how she did this boring, tedious job. She would press every item with absolute attention to every single detail. How, I thought, could any human being do that repetitive task with so much attention to detail?
Over the years, I've thought that is probably where I get a lot of what motivates me, this notion that whatever you do, however lofty or lowly it is, there is something ennobling about carrying out a task well. She's really the person who influenced me the most.
