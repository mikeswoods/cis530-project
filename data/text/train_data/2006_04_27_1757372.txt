There is nothing worse than popping in a disc loaded with treasured memories, or even just a favorite movie or sound recording, only to find that the data has disappeared because the disc has deteriorated.
The new Kodak Preservation DVD-R and CD-R products are made to preserve data for 100 years on the DVD-R and 300 years on the CD-R. KMP Media, which is manufacturing the discs under license from Kodak, says they are made with a reflective layer of 24-karat gold, which prevents the tarnish and oxidation that occur with common silver discs.
