WHEN Bill H. Adams read last fall that a bigger tax break on hybrid cars would take effect on Jan. 1, he decided that buying a Toyota Prius could wait.
Mr. Adams and his wife, Anna M. Ciambotti, had been considering the car for its gas-sipping engine and environmental Ã©lan. The tax benefit didn't hurt, either. People who bought cars last year with gasoline-and-electric hybrid engines can file for a $2,000 tax deduction on their 2005 federal returns. But while researching hybrids, Mr. Adams learned that for 2006 Congress had switched the deduction to a more lucrative tax credit.
