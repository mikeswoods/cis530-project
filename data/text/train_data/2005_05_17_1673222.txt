Toyota Motor is set to announce Tuesday that it plans to build a gas-electric hybrid version of its top-selling Camry sedan, people briefed on the company's plans said on Monday.
The hybrid Camry, to be built at Toyota's Georgetown, Ky., plant, would be the company's first gas-electric vehicle to be produced in the United States.
