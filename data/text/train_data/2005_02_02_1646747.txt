President Hugo Ch치vez of Venezuela signaled on Tuesday that his government was interested in selling its American oil-refining operations, in the latest illustration of an energy strategy that has raised doubt whether Venezuela would continue as a reliable source of oil for the United States.
Mr. Ch치vez, speaking on Tuesday during a visit to Argentina, said the government-controlled oil company, Petr칩leos de Venezuela, was looking to sell as many as eight refineries in the United States. They are owned entirely or in part by Citgo, which is based in Houston and is controlled by Petr칩leos de Venezuela, and they have long been used to process crude oil from Venezuela.
