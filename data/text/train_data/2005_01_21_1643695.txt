TALK about fast food. The sandwich developed for Burger King by the winning team on the episode of ''The Apprentice'' that ran last night on NBC will go on sale today at 7,800 restaurants around the country.
The addition of the Western Angus Steak Burger sandwich to the Burger King menu underscores how the integration of sponsors into episodes of ''The Apprentice'' is being intensified as the series starts its third season. The goal of brands like Burger King in affiliating with ''The Apprentice,'' normally shown on Thursday nights, is to stimulate product sales over busy shopping weekends as well as to generate interest and word-of-mouth around the water cooler on Friday mornings.
