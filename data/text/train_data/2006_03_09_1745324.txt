With AT&T proposing to buy BellSouth, Wall Street is looking to Verizon, the second-biggest Bell company, to make the next move.
Verizon has already said it wants to buy out Vodafone, which owns 45 percent of Verizon Wireless. But while taking full control of the wireless division would allow Verizon to include all the profits from its mobile phone division on its income statements, some investors say that Verizon would be smarter to sit tight, at least for now.
