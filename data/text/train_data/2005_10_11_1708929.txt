Refco Inc., a futures-trading company that went public two months ago, ousted its chief executive yesterday after discovering that a firm he controlled owed the company$430 million. Refco's shares fell 45 percent, reducing the company's market value by $1.65 billion.
Refco said that Phillip R. Bennett, the chairman and chief executive, had been suspended yesterday, although he repaid the $430 million in cash the same day. It said that it had hired forensic accountants to look into the matter and that it would delay its quarterly filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
