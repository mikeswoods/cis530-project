Q. You recently resigned from a comfortable job, but you'd like to return. How can you engineer that?
A. Your previous work may not make you a shoo-in for rehiring, said Danit Ran Schreiber, president of Image Democracy, a business consulting firm in White Plains. ''You need to demonstrate that you are the best fit for that position, based on your previous experience, education and personal skills,'' Ms. Schreiber said.
