The long business career of William G. Pietersen has taken him from his native South Africa to the United States. Over the years, he has served as an executive for corporate giants like Unilever and Seagram. Now he is in a prime-time South African television series based on his management advice.
Mr. Pietersen, 67, is the host of a 12-part series called ''Reinventing Strategy'' on Summit Television, a business and financial news channel that broadcasts to about 850,000 households in South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland and seven other African nations. The television shows are based on his book of the same name (John Wiley & Sons, 2002).
