NBC dismissed the executive producer of its morning news program ''Today'' yesterday, acknowledging that it was concerned about its rapidly diminishing ratings advantage in the lucrative area of morning television.
A senior NBC News executive said NBC dismissed the producer, Tom Touchet, who had held the post since November 2002. He is the third executive producer forced off the show since January 2001.
