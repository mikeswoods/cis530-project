Sun Microsystems, the maker of computer servers and software, reported yesterday that its quarterly revenues rose slightly and that its net loss narrowed as it benefited from two acquisitions.
After years as one of Silicon Valley's biggest success stories, Sun's revenues began a free fall nearly five years ago. But while the company appears to be gaining traction, its latest results indicate that it is still too early to claim a turnaround, analysts said.
