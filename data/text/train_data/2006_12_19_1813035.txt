American Apparel, the casual clothing chain whose socially conscious manufacturing, sexually charged advertising and snug-fitting T-shirts have generated a cultlike following, will be sold to a little-known investment firm for $382.5 million, according to people briefed on the matter.
The decision to sell the privately held company, expected to be announced today, is a surprise move by the company's eccentric founder, Dov Charney, who is known for exercising strict, and at times controversial, control over the retailer's operations.
