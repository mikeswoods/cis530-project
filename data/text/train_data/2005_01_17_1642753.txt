There was a time when researching a high school or college term paper was a far simpler thing. A student writing about, say, Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, might have checked out a book on the history of aviation from the local library or tucked into the family's dog-eared Britannica. An ambitious college freshman might have augmented the research by looking up some old newspaper clips on microfilm or picking up a monograph in the stacks.
Today, in a matter of minutes, students can identify these and thousands of other potential resources on the Internet -- and, as any teacher will attest, they are not always adept at sorting the wheat from the chaff.
