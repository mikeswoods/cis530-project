I WENT to London a few weeks ago for five days and left my husband a multipage schedule for our sons' activities.
The three school days were pretty easy -- drag them out of bed, make sure they are wearing clothes that are at least remotely appropriate for the weather outside, down the five-minute breakfast, frantically look for lost folders and backpacks and, with a sigh of relief, drop them off at the school gates.
