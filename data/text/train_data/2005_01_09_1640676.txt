AS a mutual fund manager whose specialty is freshly minted public companies, Linda R. Killian is in the business of making risky investments. But she couldn't quite bring herself to buy shares in Marchex, an online marketing company that made its Wall Street debut last March.
Ms. Killian, a founder of Renaissance Capital, the Greenwich, Conn., firm that created the first initial public offering mutual fund, passed on Marchex because it was young -- just 14 months old at the time -- and had yet to turn a profit. ''We gave Marchex a very, very weak rating on fundamentals,'' she said.
