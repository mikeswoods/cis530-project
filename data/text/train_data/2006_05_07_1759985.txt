I GREW up in Medina, Wash., a suburb of Seattle. We lived a block from Lake Washington, and when I was in high school my father bought a speedboat. Every day before school, even in winter, my siblings and I and our friends would water-ski until our arms almost fell off. Having a boat was an asset for meeting girls.
My first job was working for Rivkin's Jewelers weekends and afternoons in high school. I did everything from cleaning toilets to changing watch batteries. My brother had the job originally, but when he got interested in girls he offered it to me if I'd give him half my salary. The store owners were surprised to see me the first day I showed up. They had no idea about my brother's arrangement with me.
