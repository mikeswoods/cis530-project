Demand for office space has been so strong in Midtown Manhattan that the vacancy rate in the area has dropped to 10 percent, the level most real estate executives consider the dividing point between a surplus of available space and a shortage.
Specialists say a scarcity of big blocks of space in Midtown will tend to force financial services firms and related companies to consider Midtown South and downtown. A result, they say, is that effective rents are likely to rise as landlords shrink concessions like periods of free rent and contributions toward interior construction.
