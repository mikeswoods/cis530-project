The maker of the Power Ranger action figures will buy the creator of Pac-Man in a $1.7 billion deal to compete for a dwindling customer base.
The Bandai Company, which makes the Power Rangers figures, agreed to buy Namco, which produced Pac-Man, in a deal that would create Japan's second-biggest toy and game company, the two companies said Monday. The new entity, to be called Namco Bandai Holdings, would be second to Sega Sammy Holdings, the company created last year in a merger of a video game maker and a manufacturer of pachinko gambling machines.
