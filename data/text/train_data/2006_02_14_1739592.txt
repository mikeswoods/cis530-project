FARES AT DULLES -- Many analysts predicted that the collapse of the discount carrier Independence Air last month would lead to higher airfares at Dulles International Airport near Washington. The airport had some of the highest average fares in the nation before Independence Air began operating there in 2004, forcing competitors to lower ticket prices. Over all, fares have not gone up much since Independence Air closed on Jan. 5, industry analysts say. But on flights in which passengers depart and return on the same day, once a staple of Independence Air's short-haul network, ticket prices have risen significantly, said Terry Trippler, the airfare analyst at Cheapseats.com. When Independence Air folded, he found, the round-trip fare for same-day flights between Dulles and Buffalo on United Airlines was $158. A month later, it had risen to $618. Dulles to Pittsburgh went to $900, from $78, on United and to $900, from $228, on US Airways.
BIGGER REGIONAL JETS -- The dynamic keeps shifting toward larger regional jets. US Airways said it had agreed with Embraer to change an existing order for 57 Embraer jets. The earlier order was for all 57 jets to be E-170's, which seat about 70. US Airways now says it will place 25 firm orders for the E-170's and take 32 additional options for E-190 jets, which seat about 100. The E-190's will be configured with 11 first-class and 88 coach seats. The entry of the E-190's into service has not been without problems. JetBlue Airways was the first to fly the aircraft in November, and has ordered 100 of them, but has since complained about delivery delays. Embraer has said the problems are being resolved. Both the E-170's and the E-190's are marketed as ''e-jets,'' to distinguish them from the cramped regional jets with 50 or fewer seats that many airlines use on domestic routes to feed passengers into hubs.
