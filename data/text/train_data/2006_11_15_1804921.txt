The Small Business Administration announced new rules yesterday intended to help small businesses obtain more federal contracts and to assure that contracts set aside for small businesses are not going to larger companies.
The new rules will require small businesses to recertify their size when they are purchased by or merged with a larger business, or at the end of the five-year point of a contract.
