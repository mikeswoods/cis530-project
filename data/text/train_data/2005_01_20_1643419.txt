The former chief executive of ImClone Systems, Samuel D. Waksal, and his father, Jack, closed the book on an insider trading case by agreeing to a final settlement yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the agreement, Samuel Waksal will pay a $3 million penalty, and his father will return $2 million in profits. The two men neither admitted nor denied any allegations.
Samuel Waksal is currently serving seven years in federal prison for violations of federal laws ranging from obstruction of justice to perjury related to his decision to sell ImClone stock in 2001 before news that the government would not approve a cancer-fighting drug made by the company.
