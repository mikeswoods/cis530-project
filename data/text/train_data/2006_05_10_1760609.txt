Many fliers look forward to boarding planes so they can get away from their phones and e-mail. That sanctuary will inch one step closer to oblivion today when the Federal Communications Commission begins to auction off frequencies for in-flight Internet service.
Nine companies, including Verizon Airfone, which pioneered pay phones in the air, are expected to enter bids for the two licenses available. The companies have developed a variety of technologies that effectively create wireless networks on planes so fliers can use their laptops to surf the Web or to make calls with voice-over-Internet technology.
