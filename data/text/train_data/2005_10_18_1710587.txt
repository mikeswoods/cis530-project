After a surge of criticism for increasing the pay of company executives while asking hourly employees to accept deep wage cuts, the chairman of Delphi said Monday that he and other managers were reducing their salaries.
Robert S. Miller, the corporate turnaround specialist who is leading Delphi through Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for $1.5 million a year, said his new salary would be $1, starting Jan. 1. The company's president, Rodney O'Neal, also said he would take a 20 percent reduction in his $1.15 million salary, and 20 other executives would accept 10 percent cuts.
