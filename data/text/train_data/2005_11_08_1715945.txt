THE Lifetime cable channel, best known for appealing to middle-age women with weepy fare like ''Murder in the Hamptons'' and the biography series ''Intimate Portrait,'' has found an unorthodox way to tap into the youth market.
Beginning this week, it will use the success of one of its syndicated comedies, ''The Golden Girls,'' to create an elaborate wireless and online promotional campaign timed to coincide with the show's 20th anniversary. While a show centered on the lives of four Miami retirees may seem to be an unusual magnet for 18-to-34-year-old viewers, Lifetime executives say the sitcom is increasingly popular with that age group.
