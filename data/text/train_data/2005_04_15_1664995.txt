In another blow to consumer confidence in the security of personal data, the fashion giant Polo Ralph Lauren said yesterday that the credit card information of some customers may have been put at risk.
The announcement comes after HSBC, the banking conglomerate, began sending letters to 180,000 holders of its GM-branded MasterCards last week to notify them of a ''security breach'' at an unidentified ''national retailer'' that may have compromised their accounts. The Wall Street Journal identified that retailer yesterday as Polo Ralph Lauren.
