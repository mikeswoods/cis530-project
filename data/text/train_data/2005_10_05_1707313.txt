Google  and Sun Microsystems announced a broad but vague agreement yesterday to develop and distribute each other's technology in a bid to expand their markets and challenge Microsoft's dominance of computer desktops.
Under the agreement, Sun will include the Google toolbar as an option when consumers download the Java programming tool, a software program that is widely considered one of Sun's crown jewels. The deal is also expected to make it easier for customers to obtain OpenOffice, Sun's freely distributed office productivity suite that competes with Microsoft Office.
