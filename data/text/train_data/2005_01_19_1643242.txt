A barrage of lawsuits has been filed against mutual funds, contending that they did not claim money due their investors from settlements of securities class-action lawsuits.
The complaints, filed in federal courts across the country, have named more than 40 fund managers, including Merrill Lynch, Vanguard, Wells Fargo, Janus and Dreyfus, accusing them of violating their fiduciary duty to investors by failing to file claims for money from settlements of shareholder lawsuits.
