Jeffrey L. Bewkes was named president and chief operating officer of Time Warner yesterday, putting him in line to succeed the chief executive, Richard D. Parsons, who is fending off efforts by some investors to break up the company.
The elevation of Mr. Bewkes comes on the heels of the company's newly cemented joint venture between its America Online division and Google, but it had been widely expected. For the last three years, he has served as Mr. Parson's co-deputy along with Don Logan, a veteran Time Inc. publishing executive who joined the company 35 years ago. But Mr. Logan, 61, has openly contemplated retirement for some time and has been on a year-to-year contract.
