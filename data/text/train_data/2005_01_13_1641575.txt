After just two months on the job, Brian Anderson, the chief financial officer of OfficeMax, resigned yesterday, less than a month after the company announced that it had uncovered improprieties in the way it accounted for rebates from a large supplier. Analysts said they believed the resignation was voluntary.
OfficeMax also said yesterday that it would delay the release of its fourth-quarter earnings, scheduled for Jan. 20, and that it expected to complete an internal inquiry into its accounting by the third week of February. The company has also said it would delay a planned buyback of about $800 million of its stock.
