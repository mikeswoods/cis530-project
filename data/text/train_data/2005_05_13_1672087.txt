Jianping Qu was 35 years old when he arrived in the United States a decade ago, a veteran of the rough and tumble of China's marketplace. He has said he left after allegations of fraud in a real estate deal led to a 90-day ''detention'' by the authorities in Shanghai.
By 2004, Mr. Qu (pronounced Chu) was a wealthy man. He had accumulated at least $100 million in cash in his personal accounts and another $300 million in the accounts of his Silicon Valley companies, in which he is both the dominant shareholder and chief executive. In a court filing in his divorce in 2003, Mr. Qu gave his annual salary as $40.1 million, making him one of the highest-paid chief executives in America.
