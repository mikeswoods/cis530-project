AT the celebrity-packed wedding of Star Jones Reynolds, the television talk show host, last November, Calvin R. Darden Jr. seemed on top of his game. With his flashing smile and his perpetually trilling cellphones, Mr. Darden, a 30-year-old stockbroker, worked the reception area at the Waldorf-Astoria -- huddling with Dave Winfield, the former baseball star, bantering with Samuel L. Jackson, the actor, and introducing the actress Angela Bassett, a former client, to a friend of his.
For Mr. Darden, who knew the groom, Al Scales Reynolds, from their early days as Merrill Lynch brokers, it was the same heady blend of celebrity glitz and Wall Street money that had fueled his rapid career ascent.
