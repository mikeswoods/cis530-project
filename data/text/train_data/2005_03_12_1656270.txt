The chief executive of Wal-Mart's British supermarket chain, Asda, will leave in the next few weeks, and become chief of the far smaller Dutch retailer, Royal Vendex.
Asda announced the departure of its chief, Tony DeNunzio, on Friday, catching some analysts and investors by surprise. They speculated that his recent failure to increase Asda's market share against its top-ranked competitor Tesco might have caused him to look for another job.
