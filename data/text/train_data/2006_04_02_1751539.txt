ON a frigid night in January, lawyers for four of the nation's largest paint manufacturers gathered in a rented office space in downtown Providence, R.I., to strategize on how to counter contentions that their clients were to blame for the state's decades-old lead-contamination problem.
Taking their seats at a conference table littered with coffee cups, they settled in for a long debate on the eve of their opportunity to present a defense in the case, after more than three months of testimony from witnesses for the state. It quickly became apparent that many of the lawyers around the table thought that the state's case was weak, according to three lawyers who were in the room. Some even wondered whether the state was holding back more incriminating evidence for some unknown strategic reason. Others voiced concern that the jury was fatigued.
