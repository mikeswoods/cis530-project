A New York State judge said yesterday that the New York Stock Exchange must turn over an internal report describing how Richard A. Grasso, its former chairman, was awarded a large pay package.
The document was authorized by Mr. Grasso's successor, John S. Reed, who passed it on to New York and federal regulators early last year.
