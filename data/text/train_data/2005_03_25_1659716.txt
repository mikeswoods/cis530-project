A French appeals court on Thursday upheld the conviction of George Soros, the former fund manager, on insider trading charges, rejecting his argument that his investment in a French bank in 1988 was not based on confidential information.
Mr. Soros, 74, now retired from money management but active as a philanthropist and author, was ordered to pay a fine of 2.2 million euros, or $2.9 million, representing the money that funds he managed made from the investment in Société Générale. He said the purchase was part of a strategy to invest in a group of companies that had been privatized by the French government.
