ABOUT four years ago, Dr. Robert Vogt-Lowell started putting money into what he now considers to be his best investment yet: medical offices for his pediatric cardiology practice.
He and his wife, Arlene, first bought a 2,200-square-foot office condominium in the Miami suburb of Kendall. Two years later, they bought a 1,500-square-foot unit nearby, in Miami Lakes. And they would like to buy space eventually in Pembroke Pines, where he also sees patients.
