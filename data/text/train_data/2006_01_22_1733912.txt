I FEEL like my life has been a series of ever-expanding circles. I grew up in Barberton, a small suburb of Akron, Ohio, just an hour from Cleveland. But we never got to Cleveland. It was too far away. I had Depression-era parents, and one thing you learned growing up in Barberton was a work ethic. Where I lived was all tire factories and chemical plants.
I worked in a lot of factories growing up, including a boxboard factory and a rubber toy factory. I started working at age 14 at a local restaurant, and I've been working since.
