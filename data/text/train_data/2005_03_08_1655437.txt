The ink is not dry on Sir Howard Stringer's contract as chief executive of the Sony Corporation, but already the entertainment industry is buzzing about whether he will continue to oversee Sony's music and movie divisions in the United States. So far, one thing appears to be abundantly clear: Sir Howard has no plans to give up the reins to the American entertainment operations anytime soon.
Sir Howard called Andrew Lack, chief executive of Sony BMG Music Entertainment, and Michael Lynton, chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, from Tokyo on Sunday night and assured them that they would continue to report to him in the newly realigned Sony, according to two Sony executives with knowledge of the discussions.
