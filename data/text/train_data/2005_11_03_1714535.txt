Jeff McClusky, a music entrepreneur who emerged as an influential behind-the-scenes player in the 1990's by devising a technique to curry favor with radio programmers while sidestepping laws against bribery, said this week that he was dumping the business model he pioneered.
The move by Mr. McClusky comes three months after the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, stunned the music business with revelations that the nation's second-biggest music corporation, Sony BMG Music Entertainment, bribed radio station personnel and engaged in other improper promotion practices. In a settlement with Mr. Spitzer, Sony BMG agreed to a series of changes -- including severing ties to certain independent promoters -- and to pay $10 million.
