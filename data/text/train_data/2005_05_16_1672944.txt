Facing its most challenging new prime-time season in two decades, NBC is expected to unveil today a schedule of freshman programs that will try to reinvigorate a comedy heritage gone fallow. And it will rely even more heavily on its reality franchise ''The Apprentice,'' which will probably run in two separate editions next fall, one starring Donald Trump, the other starring Martha Stewart.
And in a somewhat surprising move, NBC plans to cancel the fourth entry in its hugely successful ''Law and Order'' franchise, ''Trial by Jury.''
