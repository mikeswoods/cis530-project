Willie Walsh, former chief excecutive of Aer Lingus, will become chief executive-designate of British Airways in early May and take over when Roderick I. Eddington, the current chief executive, steps down in September, British Airways said Tuesday.
The airline hopes that the appointment will continue its turnaround. The process was begun by Mr. Eddington, 55, who is credited with reviving British Airways after the slump that began in 2001 by eliminating around 14,000 jobs in the last three years. In a statement, the chairman of British Airways, Martin F. Broughton, said Mr. Eddington had ''performed miracles.''
