Willem F. Duisenberg, the blunt-spoken Dutch central banker who oversaw the introduction of the euro as the first president of the European Central Bank, was found dead on Sunday in a swimming pool at his villa in the south of France, the French government said. He was 70.
An autopsy showed that Mr. Duisenberg drowned after unspecified heart trouble. He ''died a natural death, due to drowning, after a cardiac problem,'' said Jean-Fran√ßois Sanpieri, a state official near the village of Faucon, where Mr. Duisenberg had his villa.
