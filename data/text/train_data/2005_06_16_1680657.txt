Setting up a potential conflict with General Motors, the president of the United Automobile Workers union said Wednesday that he would not agree to change G.M.'s labor contract before it expires in 2007 or to roll back health benefits for G.M. hourly workers to match the lesser benefits of the company's salaried employees.
In an extended interview the union's leader, Ron Gettelfinger, said that while he was willing to make concessions to help General Motors within the terms of their existing contract, the two sides were not yet close to reaching an agreement. G.M., he said, had not presented him with enough information to convince him of the severity of the financial situation.
