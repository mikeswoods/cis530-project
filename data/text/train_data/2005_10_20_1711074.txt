Federal prosecutors said yesterday that one of the 19 executives charged in an investigation of tax shelters sold by the accounting firm KPMG might try to flee the country and should be detained pending trial.
The executive, David Greenberg, a former tax partner at KPMG, was arrested Monday afternoon in Los Angeles. At a hearing yesterday, prosecutors accused Mr. Greenberg of falsifying documents to hide his involvement in questionable tax shelters, coaching a co-conspirator to lie to investigators and misleading investigators about whether he had surrendered all his passports.
