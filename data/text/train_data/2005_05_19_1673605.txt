As public wireless networks increase, it's easier than ever to stay connected to the Internet when roaming the land with a laptop, but there are still times when the search for a Wi-Fi hot spot runs cold. Sony's new Vaio T-series laptops can keep you surfing, thanks to their ability to catch a wave on Cingular's wireless Edge data network.
The Vaio T-series machines (which include the VGN-T350P/L running Windows XP Professional and the VGN-T350/L with Windows XP Home) weigh slightly more than three pounds. They come with a 10.6-inch screen and have Sony's SmartWi program, which lets you quickly search for and select the best available wireless connection.
