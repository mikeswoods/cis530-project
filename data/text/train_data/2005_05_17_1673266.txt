The head of Time Warner's consumer book division announced his resignation yesterday, surprising employees who have seen the publisher rebound after being put up for sale just two years ago.
Laurence J. Kirshbaum, the chairman and chief executive of the Time Warner Book Group, said in a memo to employees that he would step down at the end of the year. He will be succeeded by David Young, who is the chairman and chief executive of the publisher's British division, Time Warner Book Group U.K.
