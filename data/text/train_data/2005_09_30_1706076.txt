The accounting firm KPMG and a law firm have agreed to pay $195 million to as many as 280 wealthy investors who bought four types of questionable shelters, the first major step by the two firms to deal with billions of dollars in potential civil claims.
The agreement also calls for the firms to pay the lead plaintiffs' lawyers $30 million in fees. Papers describing the settlement were filed in federal court in Newark this week; it will be presented to a judge next week for approval.
