When more than 100 partners of Coudert Brothers, one of the oldest law firms in New York, gathered for their annual meeting in a ballroom at the Hotel Pierre in December 1987, they had reason to celebrate: the firm was about to open an office in Moscow, putting the first foreign lawyers in the Soviet Union, then in the early days of glasnost.
''They were all screaming and cheering,'' recalled Tom Brislin, a partner at Coudert at the time.
