Merck's day in court has been delayed. In a joint filing yesterday, lawyers for Merck and the widow of a man who died after reportedly taking the Merck drug Vioxx asked a state judge in Alabama to postpone the lawsuit, which was scheduled to be the first Vioxx case to go to trial. Both sides expect the judge to agree to postpone the case, which is scheduled to begin on May 23.
A second trial, scheduled to begin in state court in Texas on May 31, may also be postponed. But W. Mark Lanier, the lawyer for the plaintiff in that case, said he expected the case to be the first to go to trial, in July.
