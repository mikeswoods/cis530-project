Strike threats by workers at United Airlines are a sign of frustration in the wake of wage and benefit cuts and the termination of their pension plans, the chief executive, Glenn F. Tilton, said yesterday.
In an interview, Mr. Tilton said he believed that United's employees knew walkouts would destroy the reorganization work done by the airline since it sought bankruptcy protection in December 2002.
