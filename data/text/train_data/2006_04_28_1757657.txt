Gazprom, the Russian natural gas monopoly, signed a major deal Thursday with an energy trading unit of the German chemical holding company BASF, advancing the Russian company's expansion into the European retail market.
The deal is the latest in a series of business moves in Europe by Gazprom, the world's largest natural gas producer. The company is seeking to acquire energy businesses to add to its assets across Europe, while it is building or planning to build pipelines to the north in the Baltic Sea and south in Turkey.
