A new preliminary inquiry by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, is seeking credit data and other information from mortgage lenders that should offer regulators a clearer picture of whether discrimination is responsible for the higher interest rates that minority borrowers often pay.
The civil rights division of the attorney general's office has requested mortgage data, measures of creditworthiness and other risk-based pricing information in letters to eight lenders with substantial operations in New York, according to a person briefed on the inquiry. Citigroup, HSBC, Washington Mutual and Wells Fargo acknowledged the request yesterday and said in separate statements that they were cooperating.
