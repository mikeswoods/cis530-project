When Rolling Stone magazine published a special issue in 2004 titled ''The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time,'' some detractors noted that the list was heavily weighted toward old favorites. For example, there are 202 songs on it from the 1960's and only 21 songs from the 1990's. The No. 1 song was Bob Dylan's ''Like a Rolling Stone,'' followed by ''Satisfaction'' by the Rolling Stones and ''Imagine'' by John Lennon.
In a shot across Rolling Stone's bow, Blender magazine, which is owned by Dennis Publishing and has a circulation of 630,000, is coming out with its own list, ''The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born,'' comprising only songs published after 1980. Their No. 1 song is Michael Jackson's ''Billie Jean,'' followed by ''B.O.B'' by OutKast and ''Sweet Child o' Mine'' by Guns N' Roses.
