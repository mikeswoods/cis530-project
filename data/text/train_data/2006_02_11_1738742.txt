Dubai appears to have won a bidding battle for control of Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation, the British shipping company, completing the emirate's rapid transformation from a local port operator to one of the world's giants.
PSA International of Singapore said unexpectedly on Friday that it would drop out of the fight for P.& O., as the British company is known, after considering Dubai's Â£3.88 billion ($6.8 billon) bid made Jan. 26.
