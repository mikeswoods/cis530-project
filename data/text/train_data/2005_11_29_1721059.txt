Simon Cowell, the star of the Fox network's biggest hit, ''American Idol,'' cleared the way for his continued participation in the show yesterday when he settled a lawsuit brought by Simon Fuller, the producer of the series.
Representatives for each man said the settlement, which was reached yesterday, ended a Â£100 million ($171 million) copyright infringement lawsuit Mr. Fuller had filed against Mr. Cowell in a British court. Mr. Fuller had accused Mr. Cowell of stealing the creative elements of the ''Idol'' franchise for his own television talent contest, ''X-Factor.''
