Martha Stewart is in prison. Richard M. Scrushy, former chief executive of HealthSouth, is sitting through jury selection at his fraud trial. Next week, Bernard J. Ebbers, the former head of WorldCom, will do the same in a court in Manhattan, as will L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former Tyco chief being retried on grand larceny charges. And if all goes according to plan, later this year Enron's top managers, including Kenneth L. Lay, its former chairman, will be on trial in Houston, charged with a raft of crimes related to that company's demise.
It must seem, at least to courthouse watchers, that the sweeping effort to clean up corporate America begun over three years ago in the aftermath of the Enron collapse is still going strong, perhaps even picking up steam. But in the boardroom and executive suites, away from the gavels and juries, a different tale has begun to emerge.
