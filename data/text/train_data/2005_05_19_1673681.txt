Morgan Stanley suffered another legal setback yesterday as a Florida jury ordered it to pay $850 million in punitive damages to the financier Ronald O. Perelman, who contended he was defrauded by the investment bank in a 1998 deal.
The decision brings to $1.45 billion the sum owed to Mr. Perelman and casts more unflattering light on Morgan Stanley's reputation at a time that it is fighting a punishing campaign by eight retired executives who are calling for the ouster of Philip J. Purcell, its chief executive.
