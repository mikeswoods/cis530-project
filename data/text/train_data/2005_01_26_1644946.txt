Sun Microsystems said yesterday that its Solaris 10 operating system would soon be available on an open-source basis, a move the company hopes will help counter the perception that its technology is too proprietary and more costly than the competition's.
The decision means the software will be free and that programmers outside of Sun will be able to customize and improve it.
