THE runways, hangars and brick administrative offices are the only things left of Henry Ford's fabled Willow Run Airport, where 8,685 B-24 long-range bombers were built during World War II and 42,000 people were employed, including Rosie the Riveter.
The 64-year-old airfield, 30 miles west of Detroit, seems like the aviation equivalent of Jurassic Park, with its remnants of old cargo planes and what was once the largest bomber factory in the world.
