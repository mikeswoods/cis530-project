Essence Communications Partners announced yesterday that it was stopping publication, at least temporarily, of Suede, an ethnic fashion magazine aimed at young women, after four issues because of high production costs.
Essence owns the magazine jointly with Time Inc., which bought 49 percent of Essence in 2000 and announced in January that it had agreed to buy the remaining 51 percent. Time officials said yesterday that the deal was still on track.
