After a lengthy search, The Atlantic Monthly yesterday named a new editor -- James Bennet, a reporter for The New York Times, who will be following a long line of storied editors from James Russell Lowell and William Dean Howells to Michael Kelly.
Mr. Bennet, 39, is The Atlantic's first official editor in chief since Mr. Kelly stepped down in September 2002 to return to writing. Mr. Kelly was on assignment for the magazine in Iraq when he was killed the following year.
