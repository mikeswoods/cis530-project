Germany inched closer to American-style corporate governance on Wednesday with the approval by Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der's cabinet of a law that would require public companies to disclose the salaries of their most senior executives.
The law, which is subject to approval by Parliament, would require companies to list salaries and bonuses for all members of their management boards, the collective bodies that run German corporations.
