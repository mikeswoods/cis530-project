Blockbuster Inc., the video rental giant, dropped its bid yesterday to acquire the Hollywood Entertainment Corporation, the second-largest video rental chain, citing the likelihood that the Federal Trade Commission would reject the deal on antitrust grounds.
The decision by Blockbuster not to renew its nearly $1 billion offer, which expired at midnight Thursday, clears the way for the No.3 rental company, Movie Gallery Inc. to complete its $850 million acquisition of Hollywood Entertainment. That merger has already received a regulatory nod.
