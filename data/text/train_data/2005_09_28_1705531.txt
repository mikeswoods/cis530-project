The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to decide whether a popular tax credit, which most states use to encourage businesses to make capital investments, violates the Constitution.
The case is an appeal by the State of Ohio and the DaimlerChrysler Corporation, which received an Ohio investment tax credit for building a Jeep plant in a depressed area of Toledo, of a court ruling that a benefit of this type interferes unconstitutionally with interstate commerce.
