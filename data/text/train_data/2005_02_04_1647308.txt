China denied on Thursday that it had helped finance the purchase of a Yukos oil subsidiary by the Russian state oil company Rosneft, while Russian officials also tried to erase any link between China and the acquisition.
Analysts said Thursday that the moves might be an attempt to avoid being sued by Yukos, which won an injunction in a bankruptcy court in Texas in December barring any company from financing a bid for the subsidiary, Yuganskneftegas.
