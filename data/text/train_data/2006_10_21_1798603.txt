The billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn appears to be gaining effective control of the board of ImClone Systems even before shareholders of the biotechnology company finish voting on his proposal to oust four directors.
Yesterday, ImClone said that Dr. Peter S. Liebert, an ally of Mr. Icahn, had been named a director of the company. It also said that Mr. Icahn would become the chairman of a board committee searching for a new chief executive.
