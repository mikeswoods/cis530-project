Wachovia has been the only big bank without its own big credit card business. Yesterday, it announced plans to re-enter the credit card market as a direct issuer, starting in January 2006.
The decision effectively ends the joint-marketing agreement that for the last six years has allowed MBNA to solicit Wachovia customers for credit card business. MBNA agreed to be acquired for $35 billion by Bank of America in June, after Wachovia passed on a deal.
