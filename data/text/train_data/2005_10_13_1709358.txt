M&C Saatchi in London has lost its flagship account as British Airways leaves the agency after a decade, shifting its worldwide creative assignment to Bartle Bogle Hegarty in London. British Airways is estimated to spend $90 million to $100 million a year on ads.
The brothers Maurice and Charles Saatchi founded M&C Saatchi in 1995 with several large accounts they had handled at their previous agency, Saatchi & Saatchi, now part of the Publicis Groupe.
