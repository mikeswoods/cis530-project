The chief lobbyist for Delta Air Lines, who has led the airline's fight for pension overhaul legislation in Washington, retired last week, Delta said yesterday. The airline's treasurer also resigned.
Delta said its senior vice president for government affairs, D. Scott Yohe, retired Aug. 1 after 26 years with the company. Mr. Yohe, 52, will become a consultant and remain as the airline's top Washington representative, a job he has held for 17 years, a Delta spokeswoman, Chris Kelly, said.
