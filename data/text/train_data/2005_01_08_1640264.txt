Morningstar, the investment research company that has been planning since last spring to go public, announced late yesterday that it would sell its initial shares through an unconventional auction method similar to the one used in the widely publicized Google initial public offering in August.
Joe Mansueto, the chairman and chief executive of Morningstar, said the decision was based more on principle than on publicity. ''The key benefit of an auction is equal access to shares and information. This equality resonated with us,'' Mr. Mansueto said in a statement yesterday. ''It is in keeping with our company philosophy of helping all investors -- not just large ones.''
