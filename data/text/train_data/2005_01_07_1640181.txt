With the federal pension insurance program in a rapid decline and bracing itself for another year of record losses, officials in the Bush administration are close to unveiling a rescue plan -- medicine they hope will be strong enough to save the agency from a costly bailout but not so strong that it kills the pension system.
The program, under the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, insures pensions in case of a failure, much the way the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guarantees bank deposits when a bank fails. It has gone from an $8 billion surplus in 2001 to a $23 billion deficit in 2004, raising questions about its long-term ability to pay retirees their pensions.
