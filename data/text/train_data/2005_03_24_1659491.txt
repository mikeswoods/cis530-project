The European Commission said Wednesday that it had rejected a set of restrictions that Microsoft wants to impose on a trustee who will be charged with policing last year's antitrust ruling against the company.
''Microsoft wished to have a veto on what issues the monitoring trustee could examine,'' said Jonathan Todd, a commission spokesman. He added that the request was ''unacceptable'' because it would undermine the role of the trustee, who has yet to be named.
