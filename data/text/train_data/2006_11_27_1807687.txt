Adults in Chicago are much more likely than those in Miami to have recently purchased a prepaid gift card, according to results of a survey by Scarborough Research, a consumer research firm.
Chicago was tied for first place with Harrisburg, Pa. The city with the second-lowest proportion of adults who had recently bought gift cards was Fresno, Calif. (39 percent), followed by New York City, with 40 percent.
