The Pentagon said yesterday that commercial airlines were flying more than double the number of troops overseas this month as they were a year ago, a reason the government expects to spend 15 percent more on such transports this quarter.
The Pentagon said yesterday that it expected commercial air carriers to move 83,000 troops overseas, compared with 40,000 in January 2004. In addition, the Pentagon expects to move 71,600 troops in February, and 75,300 in March.
