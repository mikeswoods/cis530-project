After failing to acquire WMC Resources of Australia, the Swiss mining company Xstrata has a new growth strategy that could include another multibillion-dollar takeover attempt.
In a letter last week to employees, Xstrata's chief executive, Michael Davis, said the company had failed to bring home the ''treasure'' -- WMC -- but that it was working on new ventures, a person who read the letter said. One of the ventures ''is more exciting than WMC'' and one of them is ''more doable,'' the letter said.
