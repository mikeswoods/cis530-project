SPORTS are entertainment. Sports do not often change our world; rather they serve as a distraction from our world.''
So begins a new book, entitled ''The Wages of Wins: Taking Measure of the Many Myths of Modern Sports.'' Written by three young, relatively obscure economists -- David J. Berri of California State University, Bakersfield; Martin B. Schmidt of the College of William and Mary; and Stacey L. Brook of the University of Sioux Falls -- it tries to do for sports, particularly basketball, what Steven D. Levitt and his co-author, Stephen J. Dubner, did for a range of social questions in their runaway best-seller, ''Freakonomics.''
