Paramount Pictures is expected on Thursday to name the talent agent John Lesher, whose clients include film directors like Martin Scorsese and David O. Russell, to be the president of its struggling Paramount Classics specialty division, people briefed on the negotiations said.
Mr. Lesher, 39, a partner at the Endeavor Talent Agency, would succeed David Dinerstein and Ruth Vitale, who founded the classics division eight years ago and ran it until they were fired Oct. 6 by Brad Grey, Paramount's chairman and chief executive. Mr. Grey has replaced several top managers since taking over the moribund studio in January.
