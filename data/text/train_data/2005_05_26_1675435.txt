The New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, and the New York Insurance Department are planning to file a civil complaint against the insurance giant American International Group; its former chairman and chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg; and its former chief financial officer, Howard I. Smith, people briefed on Mr. Spitzer's plans said yesterday.
The complaint, they said, would accuse those named of involvement in improper accounting that allowed A.I.G. to make its financial position look stronger than it actually was.
