In an unusual advertisement that ran briefly in New York movie theaters, customers and employees suddenly begin to trash a Gap store. One man tackles a mannequin, tearing off its shirt with his teeth, while another slices through a display case with a chain saw. A woman, spotting the pandemonium, drives her minivan through the front doors.
The ad was intended to introduce a remodeled Gap store, but it may be a fitting metaphor for the retailer itself. Sales are slumping across all three divisions, several executives have left recently and Wall Street analysts are openly questioning whether the company's leadership is up to the job.
