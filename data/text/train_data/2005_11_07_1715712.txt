Television viewers in Montgomery, Ala., might have an opportunity to get to know Richard M. Scrushy, the former chief executive of the HealthSouth Corporation, a lot better.
Mr. Scrushy's son-in-law, Michael Plaia, acquired a cable television station in the area just weeks before Mr. Scrushy appeared in federal court to plead not guilty to charges of bribing a former governor of Alabama. And Mr. Plaia said he was open to broadcasting ''Viewpoint,'' a religious show that Mr. Scrushy was host of in Birmingham, Ala., while on trial there.
