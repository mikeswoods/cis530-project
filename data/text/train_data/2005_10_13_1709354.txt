In the latest skirmish in a bitter war over the best-selling drug ever created by biotechnology, Johnson & Johnson has filed an antitrust suit accusing rival Amgen of using illegal leverage to drive its drug, Procrit, out of the market.
In a suit filed Tuesday in Federal District Court in Trenton, N.J., Johnson & Johnson said Amgen was bundling sales of its drugs in a way that forces cancer clinics to buy Amgen's Aranesp at the expense of Procrit.
