WHEN Cynthia Letterman, 56, a retired aerospace engineer, opens her home to visits from her 4 children and 14 grandchildren, it could become a zoo -- if it weren't one already. Among the inhabitants are coatimundis, kinkajous, fennec foxes, sugar gliders, ring-tailed lemurs, marmoset monkeys, eclectus and sun conure parrots, as well as a prairie dog named Fido.
''They're my babies,'' says Ms. Letterman, who lives in Bay City, Tex., and who owned just a couple of dogs while rearing her first family. ''I always wanted something different when I retired.''
