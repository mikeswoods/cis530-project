Gordon A. Paris, the new president and chief executive of Hollinger International, could be paid about $4 million a year and could earn as much as $9 million if the company changes hands, according to a company filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The company is suing its former chief executive, Conrad M. Black, accusing him of taking excessive compensation. Lord Black received $7.9 million in 2002, the last year for which his compensation has been disclosed. A report last summer said that from 1997 to 2003, Lord Black and others transferred more than $400 million to themselves -- about 95 percent of the company's profit. Lord Black denies any wrongdoing.
