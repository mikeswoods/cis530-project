Lawyers for Richard A. Grasso, the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, have filed a motion in a New York state court asking to see a report that chronicled how Mr. Grasso came to receive a $139.5 million pay package.
Commissioned in late 2003 by John S. Reed, Mr. Grasso's successor, the document, known widely as the Webb report, was prepared by the exchange's lawyer, Dan K. Webb of the firm of Winston & Strawn. It consists of interviews with more than 60 people, including past and present directors of the stock exchange.
