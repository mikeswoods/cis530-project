Three days after Riggs National filed a lawsuit against the PNC Financial Services Group for failing to complete a merger, the banks announced yesterday that they had resolved their differences and planned to merge as soon as possible.
Under a revised deal, PNC will pay $20 a share, or about $652 million, to acquire Riggs, which has been mired in a money-laundering investigation. PNC, based in Pittsburgh, originally offered Riggs $24.25 a share in a $779 million takeover announced in July. According to the suit, which Riggs has since agreed to withdraw, the talks foundered because PNC wanted to revise the original terms and pay $19.32 a share.
