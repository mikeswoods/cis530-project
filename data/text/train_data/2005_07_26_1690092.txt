Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the No.1 source of generic drugs in the United States, said yesterday that it would acquire the Ivax Corporation for about $7.4 billion in a bid to become the world's largest maker of lower-cost drugs.
The deal will allow the companies to pool their resources at a time when mounting competition is forcing the industry to cut prices and provide a wider range of products. As copies of drugs formerly under patent, generics have become a commodity in the United States and elsewhere, and pharmaceutical companies must operate internationally, analysts said.
