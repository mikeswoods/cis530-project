I.B.M. delivered a solid quarterly performance yesterday with earnings exceeding Wall Street's expectations, suggesting that corporate spending on information technology is continuing to pick up modestly.
I.B.M., the world's largest information technology company, is closely watched as a barometer of business spending on technology. About one dollar of every $10 spent by corporations worldwide on technology is spent on I.B.M. hardware, software or services.
