Decades ago, I wrote an article about a police officer who was notorious for roughing up suspects before he took them in for booking. The term-of-art within the Minneapolis police department for that kind of officer was ''thumper,'' and there was plenty in the public record to suggest that the noun fit him nicely.
He called me after the story ran, livid about being labeled a ''thumper.'' He was a scary guy and I equivocated for a bit before I was finally able to stammer out, ''is it worse that I said it, or worse that it's true?''
