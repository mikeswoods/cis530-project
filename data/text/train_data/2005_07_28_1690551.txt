Delta Air Lines shares plunged yesterday on a fresh warning by its chief executive that its reorganization plan was not shielding it from brutal competition, and that the airline would have to do more to avoid seeking bankruptcy protection.
The bleak words, contained in a memo to employees from Delta's chief executive, Gerald Grinstein, echoed comments that Mr. Grinstein made last week when Delta announced a $382 million loss for the second quarter. Including its second-quarter loss, Delta has lost nearly $10 billion since the year 2000.
