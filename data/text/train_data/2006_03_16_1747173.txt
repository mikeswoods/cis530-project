The Russian state oil company Rosneft has acquired $482 million in debt that the troubled oil company Yukos owed to Western banks, Yukos said Wednesday. The step raised the possibility that Rosneft might acquire Yukos's remaining assets.
In a statement on its Web site, Yukos said it appeared that Rosneft acquired the debt in December.
