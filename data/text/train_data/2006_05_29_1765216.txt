The investment bank Goldman Sachs is trying to organize Arcelor shareholders to block the steel company's controversial plans to sell off a major stake to Severstal, a Russian company.
Arcelor's management signed a deal with Severstal late last week as a last-ditch attempt to fend off a hostile 26 billion euro ($33 billion) takeover by Mittal Steel, the world's largest steel company. Arcelor has objected to Mittal's offer since it was first made on friendly terms in January. Arcelor said on Friday that it would make a deal worth 13 billion euros ($16.5 billion) with Severstal, selling off a third of the company to Severstal's chief executive, Alexei Mordashov, in exchange for his stake in Severstal and other assets.
