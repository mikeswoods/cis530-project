Dell Inc. warned investors yesterday that its shift in strategy to focus on higher profit margins would result in lower-than-expected revenue and earnings in the third quarter.
The surprise announcement, made after the close of trading, pushed its shares down more than 4 percent in after-hours trading; shares were up 82 cents, to $31.88, in regular trading.
