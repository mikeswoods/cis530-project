THE stock market in the United States has performed very well since the fall of 2002, when the sell-off started by the bursting of the Internet bubble and accelerated by Sept. 11 and the 2001 recession finally came to an end.
Since then, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up nearly 60 percent, a strong gain that the Bush administration has pointed to as reflecting an economic recovery brought on by tax cuts.
