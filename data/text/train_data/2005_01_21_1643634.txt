Malcolm Brachman, a Texas businessman and onetime nuclear physicist who was among the first bridge enthusiasts to finance his own team, died on Jan. 11 at his daughter's home in Chapel Hill, N.C. He was 78 and until recently a Dallas resident.
The cause was complications of pancreatic cancer, said Lisa Brachman, his daughter.
