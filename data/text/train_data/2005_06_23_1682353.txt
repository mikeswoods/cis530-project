Citigroup is expected to announce today an agreement to swap its asset management business for Legg Mason's brokerage business as well as cash and stock, in a deal worth a total of about $4 billion, one person close to the talks said yesterday.
A deal, which has been anticipated, would allow Citigroup, the world's largest financial services firm, to focus on selling investment products while getting out of the business of creating funds for individual and institutional clients.
