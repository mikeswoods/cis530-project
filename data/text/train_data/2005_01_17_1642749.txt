India's prime minister warned on Sunday that China had moved ahead in securing worldwide oil and natural gas supplies, the bluntest expression yet of energy worries among Indian leaders. In the last two weeks, they have pursued a series of energy deals that have surprised global markets.
''I find China ahead of us in planning for the future in the field of energy security,'' Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in a speech here at the convention of India's oil and gas industry. ''We can no longer be complacent and must learn to think strategically, to think ahead, and to act swiftly and decisively.''
