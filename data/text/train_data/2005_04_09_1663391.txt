Syngenta, the Swiss agrochemicals company, was fined $375,000 by the United States Department of Agriculture for inadvertently selling unapproved genetically altered corn seed, the company said Friday.
The Department of Agriculture also required Syngenta to develop a training program to keep the mix-up in seeds from happening again, the company said.
