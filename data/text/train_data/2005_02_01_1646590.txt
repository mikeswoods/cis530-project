MetLife said yesterday that it would buy Citigroup's life insurance business in a deal valued at $11.5 billion, a move that strengthens its position as one of the largest companies in an industry that is continuing to consolidate.
In its largest acquisition, MetLife will pay $8.5 billion to $10.5 billion in cash for Citigroup's life and annuity division and nearly all of its international insurance operations. The rest of the purchase will be in MetLife stock.
