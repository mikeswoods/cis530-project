Scott Rudin, a veteran producer whose films last year ranged from a failed remake of ''The Stepford Wives'' to a well-received adaptation of Broadway's ''Closer,'' said Tuesday that he would end his long-standing deal with Paramount Pictures and begin making movies for Walt Disney Studios when his contract expires in 2006.
Mr. Rudin is the first major producer to leave Paramount since the former talent manager Brad Grey joined the company as chief executive last month in a management shake-up. It has been widely expected that Mr. Rudin would leave the studio, where his 15-year tenure was rooted in a close relationship with the departing Paramount chairwoman, Sherry Lansing.
