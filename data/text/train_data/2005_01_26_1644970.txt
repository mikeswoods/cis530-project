Partners at two prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firms deceived four of the five founders of a start-up company, withholding critical information and thereby cheating them out of tens of millions of dollars, according to a lawsuit.
The suit, filed in Superior Court here last week, was brought on behalf of three of the five founders of Epinions, a consumer product review Web site founded in 1999 that quickly became one of the dot-com era's more celebrated start-ups. The suit named J. William Gurley of Benchmark Capital and John R. Johnston of August Capital, both original investors in Epinions and directors of the company, and an Epinions co-founder, Nirav N. Tolia.
