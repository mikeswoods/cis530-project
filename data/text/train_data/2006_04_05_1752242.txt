Katie Couric will announce her decision leave NBC's Today'' show, the program she has led to morning news dominance for the past 10 years, at 7:30 this morning during the broadcast of ''Today,'' a prelude to a formal announcement by CBS that she will join that network as its new evening news anchor.
Her announcement, on the 15th anniversary of her first broadcast on ''Today,'' will bring to an end one of the most closely followed talent courtships in recent network history. CBS has sought to secure Ms. Couric's services for well over a year, and NBC made several efforts to keep her at ''Today,'' its most profitable program.
