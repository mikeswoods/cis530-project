Nasdaq started the takeover clock ticking on Tuesday when it officially made a $5.3 billion hostile bid for the London Stock Exchange.
Stockholders will initially have until Jan. 11 to tender their shares to Nasdaq, which is offering Â£12.43 ($24.49) apiece. Nasdaq already holds 28.75 percent of the London market and needs a simple majority, or just one share over 50 percent, to take control. It can extend that deadline once, to Feb. 10.
