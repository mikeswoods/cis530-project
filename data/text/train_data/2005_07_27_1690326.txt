I.B.M. introduced a new line of mainframe computer yesterday that is not only twice as powerful as its predecessor but also aims to make it easier for corporations to encrypt vast amounts of customer information and to bundle the workloads of many smaller computers onto an I.B.M. mainframe.
The new line, called the z9, is the result of a three-year, $1.2 billion development effort involving 5,000 I.B.M. engineers. Maintaining the health of the mainframe business, which accounts for a small percentage of the company's revenues these days, is still important to I.B.M. The big machines, which typically cost several million dollars, pull in a lot of other business for I.B.M., including sales of software, services, financing and other hardware, like storage systems, analysts say.
