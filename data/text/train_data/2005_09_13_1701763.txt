Oracle, the giant database-software maker, announced on Monday that it would pay $5.85 billion to acquire Siebel Systems, its largest competitor in the market for sales automation programs.
The deal will bolster Oracle's effort to topple its German rival SAP as the leading seller of business applications software for big corporations.
