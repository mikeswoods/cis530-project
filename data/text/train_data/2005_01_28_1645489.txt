A prescription drug that treats erectile dysfunction is returning to the Super Bowl for a second consecutive year, with a 60-second commercial to run during the third quarter of the Fox Broadcasting telecast on Feb. 6.
The drug is Cialis, which made its Super Bowl debut last year along with a competitor, Levitra. The Cialis spot, by Grey Worldwide in New York, part of the Grey Global Group, raised eyebrows with an announcer's line that cautioned about possible side effects like erections lasting longer than four hours.
