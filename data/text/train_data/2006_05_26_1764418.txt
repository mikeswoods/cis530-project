Moving swiftly to fend off a public stock offering, the founding family of Germany's leading media conglomerate, Bertelsmann, announced Thursday that it had agreed to buy out its only outside shareholder for 4.5 billion euros, or $5.8 billion.
The deal, which came two days after the shareholder, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, gained the legal right to demand an offering, will return Bertelsmann to the full control of the Mohn family.
