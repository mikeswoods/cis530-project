Verizon Communications yesterday signaled its unwillingness to raise its $7.6 billion offer for MCI and said it was prepared to walk away from its agreement to buy the company.
In what amounted to an ultimatum, Ivan G. Seidenberg, chief executive of Verizon, in a letter to MCI's board, said if the board decided that Qwest's $8.9 billion bid was ''superior,'' Verizon would scrap the current deal.
