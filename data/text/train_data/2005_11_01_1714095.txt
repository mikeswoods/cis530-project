Making a big move into the vaccine business, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis said yesterday that it would acquire control of the Chiron Corporation, a manufacturer of flu shots that has been beset by quality control problems.
Novartis, which already owns 42 percent of Chiron, will pay $45 a share, or a total of $5.1 billion, for the 113 million shares of Chiron it does not already own.
