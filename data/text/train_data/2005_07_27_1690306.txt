Turning up the pressure on its unions and Congress, Northwest Airlines said yesterday that it would have to seek bankruptcy protection without $1.1 billion in wage and benefit cuts and the passage of a pension reform bill.
Northwest's warning, its most dire to date, came as the airline posted a deeper net loss for the second quarter. Northwest lost $279 million, or $3.21 a share, compared with $78 million, or 90 cents a share, not including unusual items, in the 2004 quarter.
