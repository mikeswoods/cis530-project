The wife of Harry C. Stonecipher, who resigned as chief executive of the Boeing Company last week after its board learned of his affair with a female executive at the company, has filed for divorce after 50 years of marriage.
Donald Schiller, the lawyer for Joan Stonecipher, confirmed yesterday that Mrs. Stonecipher filed a petition on Thursday with the Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, where Boeing is based.
