Bowing to pressure from consuming nations, including the United States, the president of OPEC said Tuesday that the oil exporting group was considering an increase in its production ceiling to help bring oil prices down from their current highs.
Sheik Ahmad Fahad al-Ahmad al-Sabah, the president of OPEC, who is also Kuwait's oil minister, said the proposal that the oil ministers were considering would raise the group's quota in two steps by as much as a million barrels of oil a day -- an immediate 500,000-barrel-a-day increase followed by an option to increase by another half a million barrels by May. The plan has to be approved on Wednesday, when the formal conference of oil ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets here.
