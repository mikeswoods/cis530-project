The president of Intel, Paul S. Otellini, warned a federal panel addressing tax issues that because of high tax rates in the United States, his company may build its next $3 billion semiconductor factory overseas.
Mr. Otellini, who will become Intel's chief executive in May, testified Thursday at a hearing of the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform that over the 10-year life of a modern chip factory, the company would save $1 billion by placing the factory in Asia or Europe rather than in the United States. He said Intel, the world's largest chip maker, would make its decision this year.
