Adding to concerns about the security of personal information, Time Warner yesterday reported the loss of computer backup tapes containing sensitive data, including the names and Social Security numbers of about 600,000 people. They include current and former employees, some of their dependents and beneficiaries, and even individuals who have simply provided services for the company.
Time Warner said the data, on 40 tapes in a container the size of a cooler, disappeared more than a month ago while being shipped to an offsite storage center.
