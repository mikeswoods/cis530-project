The Ford Motor Company lowered its earnings forecast for the year on Friday, citing higher gas prices and rising health care costs. The company said it would also abandon its goal of $7 billion in pretax profit by 2006, a cornerstone of the turnaround plan that its chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., put in place after he took control in 2001.
Ford, the nation's second-largest automaker, now expects to earn $1.25 to $1.50 a share for the year, down from its previous guidance of $1.75 to $1.90 a share.
