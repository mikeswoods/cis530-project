The Securities and Exchange Commission won a court order yesterday to secure documents in the investigation into various American International Group transactions with offshore reinsurance companies and privately held entities closely aligned with the company.
The court order, issued in Federal District Court in Manhattan, prohibits Maurice R. Greenberg, former chairman and chief executive of A.I.G.; the company itself; and C.V. Starr, a privately held insurance company that was owned and run by A.I.G. executives and officers, from destroying any documents related to the investigation. It also puts into effect procedures for different participants to examine documents.
