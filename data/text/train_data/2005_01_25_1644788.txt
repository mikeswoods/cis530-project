The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the full amount of a court award or legal settlement is taxable to the successful plaintiff, even if a sizable portion goes directly to a lawyer under a contingent fee agreement.
The lower federal courts have been split on the question. Acting on government appeals in two cases, the justices voted 8 to 0, with the ailing Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist not participating, to overturn decisions by the federal appeals courts in San Francisco and Cincinnati. Both courts had rejected the Internal Revenue Service's position that all economic gain is taxable to the person who has earned it, unless specifically exempted by Congress.
