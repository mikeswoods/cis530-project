The Sony Corporation warned on Thursday that sales and operating profit would probably fall short of its forecasts because of rapidly declining prices for DVD recorders and video cameras, as well as stiff competition from Apple's popular iPod.
Sony, one of Japan's best-known electronics companies, now expects an operating profit of 110 billion yen ($1.07 billion) for the fiscal year ending March 31, it said, compared with an earlier forecast of 160 billion yen, a decrease of about 30 percent. Sony also trimmed its forecast for revenue for the year to 7.15 trillion yen ($69.6 billion ) from 7.35 trillion yen. The company raised its net income forecast, but only because of tax savings in its United States operation.
