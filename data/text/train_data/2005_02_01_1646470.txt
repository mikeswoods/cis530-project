Intensifying competition in the market for sports video games, Take-Two Interactive Software said yesterday that it had licensed the rights from Major League Baseball and its players' association to market games using major-league teams, players, uniforms and stadiums.
Under the agreement, which takes effect in the spring of 2006, Take-Two will be the only independent game developer allowed to make games using the official baseball brand.
