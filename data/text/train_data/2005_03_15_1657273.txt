Maurice R. Greenberg, the executive who built American International Group into a global insurance powerhouse and shaped an entire industry during nearly 40 years at the company's helm, stepped down as chief executive yesterday after a series of run-ins with regulators raised questions about its complex and often obscure operations.
His exit came after lengthy discussions by the company's directors in recent days and appeared intended to avert a head-on collision with two regulators: the Securities and Exchange Commission and Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general.
