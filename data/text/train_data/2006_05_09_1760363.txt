I WOULD last maybe one shift as a flight attendant.
Maybe just one connection, because they would probably escort me off at the first stop and hand me a bus ticket home after some passenger in 23C gave me a hundred-dollar bill for a beer while I was trying to keep track of the dozen other people I still owed change for their ham and cheese sandwiches. That does not even include helping the passenger in 27B with the crying infant.
