WHEN my father asked me for help with his life insurance, I na√Øvely assumed it would be a straightforward matter of dollars and cents.
A Korean War veteran, Dad signed up for National Service Life Insurance when he was discharged from the Marine Corps in 1953. Like a lot of young servicemen then, he bought a five-year term policy worth $10,000 because the premiums were quite low -- about $20 every three months, he recalls.
