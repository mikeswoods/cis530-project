The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note went below 4.10 percent yesterday for the first time since February, a move that could confound the Federal Reserve's effort to slow economic growth. At the same time, however, the rally in Treasuries appears to reflect a decline in inflationary fears.
That view was given at least one day of support yesterday with the report that the core Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy costs, was unchanged in April. Analysts had forecast an increase of 0.2 percent.
