Until recently it was complicated for casual photographers to shoot digital pictures underwater. You had to buy a separate waterproof housing for your camera and then worry about how well it would work.
The Optio WP from Pentax has taken out the middleman. The $350 digicam does not require a separate housing to keep it watertight. Pentax says it will function for up to 30 minutes in water up to 5 feet deep, and it's dunkable right out of the box.
