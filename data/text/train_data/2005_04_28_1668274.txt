The Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that farmers whose crops are damaged by federally approved pesticides or herbicides may pursue damage claims against the manufacturers in state court.
The 7-to-2 decision was one of the court's most significant rulings on the pre-emptive effect of federal statutes. In unusually pointed terms, the majority rejected the Bush administration's view that lawsuits claiming manufacturers negligently designed, tested or manufactured their products are pre-empted by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, the federal law that governs the registration and labeling of these products.
