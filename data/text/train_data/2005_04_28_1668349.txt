L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive of the conglomerate Tyco International, took the stand to declare his innocence at his retrial yesterday, a surprising reversal in strategy from his first trial, at which he did not testify.
As word spread early yesterday at the New York State Supreme Court in Lower Manhattan that Mr. Kozlowski was about to testify, the courtroom, often nearly empty, quickly filled with spectators. Mr. Kozlowski is on trial on larceny accusations and other charges.
