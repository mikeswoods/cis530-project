In another blow to Havas, Volkswagen of America in Auburn Hills, Mich., has named MediaCom in New York, part of the Grey Global Group, to handle the media planning and buying duties on its account, which had been handled for nearly a decade by a Havas unit, the Boston office of MPG USA. Spending was estimated at $500 million.
The decision, which came after a four-month review, consolidates most of Volkswagen's worldwide media buying with MediaCom, whose parent, Grey, is being acquired by the WPP Group. The move does not affect the creative part of VW's United States account, which remains at another Havas agency, Arnold Worldwide in Boston.
