HBO, as part of its campaign to promote the coming third season of its popular comedy ''Entourage,'' which starts this Sunday, is offering Internet users the chance to undergo a nerve-racking job interview with the cutthroat Hollywood agent Ari Gold, played by Jeremy Piven.
''Entourage'' is a biting satire that follows the story of the rising film star Vincent Chase, who comes to Hollywood via Queens with his brother and two friends to become an actor, with the help of his agent, the fast-talking Mr. Gold.
