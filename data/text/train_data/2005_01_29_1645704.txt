The American economy slowed to an annual growth rate of 3.1 percent in the final three months of 2004, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. That was the weakest quarterly pace in nearly two years, held down by a surge in imports, which substituted for production at home.
Consumers provided most of the lift, increasing their outlays for goods and services by more than enough to offset weaknesses in other areas. They spent most heavily on food and medical care, with home furnishings, home maintenance and motor vehicles not far behind.
