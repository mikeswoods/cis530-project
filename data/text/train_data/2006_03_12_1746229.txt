ONE of the funniest movies I have ever seen is ''Monty Python's The Meaning of Life.'' In one scene, a conglomerate's senior executives are meeting and one of them is invited to report on the sixth item on the agenda: the meaning of life.
The eager executive responds: ''Yeah, I've had a team working on this over the past few weeks, and what we've come up with can be reduced to two fundamental concepts. One: People aren't wearing enough hats. Two: Matter is energy. In the universe there are many energy fields which we cannot normally perceive. Some energies have a spiritual source which act upon a person's soul. However, this 'soul' does not exist ab initio as orthodox Christianity teaches; it has to be brought into existence by a process of guided self-observation. However, this is rarely achieved owing to man's unique ability to be distracted from spiritual matters by everyday trivia.''
