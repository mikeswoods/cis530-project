Sidney Frank, the flamboyant liquor baron who sold his Grey Goose vodka to Bacardi last year for more than $2 billion, has an idea for a publishing business. Instead of starting a new magazine, he plans to buy several existing titles, then consolidate them into one magazine focused on creating ''best of'' lists across a range of categories like travel, food, sports and entertainment.
''My goal is to fill a niche in the media world that is missing -- a lifestyle publication that offers readers a road map to the best luxury products to buy, places to travel and restaurants to taste,'' Mr. Frank said.
