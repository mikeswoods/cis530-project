Not many executives have heard of Cardinal Bankshares or its main business unit, the Bank of Floyd. But they will.
In the first case of a whistle-blower protected by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, an administrative law judge for the Labor Department has ordered Cardinal to rehire its former chief financial officer, David E. Welch, and to pay him nearly $65,000 in back pay and damages. The judge, Stephen L. Purcell, also instructed the bank to pay Mr. Welch's $108,000 legal bill.
