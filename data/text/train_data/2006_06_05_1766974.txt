The Y&R Advertising unit of Young & Rubicam Brands has ended a lengthy search for a chief executive by hiring from within.
Hamish McLennan, 40, chairman and chief executive for the Australian and New Zealand operations of Y.& R. Brands, will begin his new job at Y&R Advertising next month, moving to New York from Sydney. The search for a new chief executive began in April 2005, when Ann Fudge said she would give up the post after a series of account losses that included Jaguar and Sony. Ms. Fudge, 55, has remained chairwoman and chief executive at Y.& R. Brands, which also includes units like Burson-Marsteller and Wunderman.
