With only a few days remaining before a Saturday deadline, about 80 of California's largest 100 companies have filed to receive part of a $1.1 billion antitrust settlement with Microsoft, a lawyer involved in the settlement said yesterday.
But it appears that only a small percentage of customers eligible to receive part of the settlement have filed to claim their share, said the lawyer, Richard L. Grossman of Townsend, Townsend & Crew, the lead lawyer representing California consumers in the settlement fight.
