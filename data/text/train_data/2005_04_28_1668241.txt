European regulators have tentatively concluded that some companies that use accounting rules developed in the United States, Canada and Japan should be required to provide additional information to investors if they want their securities to continue trading in Europe.
The report by a working group of the Committee of European Securities Regulators is to be released Thursday, but was made available by officials on Wednesday. It concludes that accounting standards in the three countries are close enough to international accounting standards to not require complete restatements, but the group mentions several areas where it says investors need information that may not be available in those countries.
