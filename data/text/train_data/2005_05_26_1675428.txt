The street vendor looked both ways before he whispered, ''I have the real ones in my car, down the street.'' He left and brought back what he initially claimed were the latest Louis Vuitton handbags, hidden in a black plastic trash bag. ''I should get $200, but for you, I'll make it $180,'' he said. The vendor, at the corner of 59th Street and Fifth Avenue, near the Plaza Hotel, was insulted when the deal, for a cheap imitation of the real thing, was turned down.
''But these are the real copies!'' he argued.
