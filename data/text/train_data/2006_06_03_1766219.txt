Airbus, which has been engaged in a dispute over trade subsidies with its rival Boeing, filed suit in a United States court yesterday, asking that a law firm representing Boeing be excluded from the case because of a conflict of interest.
In a filing in Superior Court of the District of Columbia, Airbus contended that Boeing's legal counsel, Marco C. E. J. Bronckers, a partner in the Brussels office of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, had inside information on Airbus because Mr. Bronckers previously represented the company in commercial aviation trade cases.
