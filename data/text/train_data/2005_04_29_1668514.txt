The United States trade representative will not immediately press for World Trade Organization action against China over widespread unlawful copying of patented and copyrighted products when it announces the results of an investigation on Friday, a United States executive informed of the decision said on Thursday.
The office of the trade representative, which monitors the United States' trade agreements, will instead place China on a ''priority watch'' list of countries that it says fail to adequately respect intellectual property rights and may be subject to future action, said the executive, who was involved in the investigation. He spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of the announcement.
