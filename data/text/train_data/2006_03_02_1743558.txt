Internet calling -- using a technology called voice- over-Internet protocol, or VoIP -- promises unlimited low-cost phone time. But for all its benefits, VoIP has drawbacks: it requires a broadband connection and often a new phone number, and 911 calls do not automatically pinpoint a caller's location in emergencies.
Enter the Chatter Bug, available for $24.95 at www.chatterbug.com. This hybrid hardware routes long-distance calls through Chatter Bug's remote VoIP system, offering unlimited calling in the United States and Canada for $9.95 a month (international calling is coming soon). Chatter Bug lets a user keep an existing phone line and number, and accommodates standard 911 services. An Internet connection is not needed to use it.
