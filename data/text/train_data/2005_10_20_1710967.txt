Even though the images produced are often blurry -- as if they're coming from the International Space Station instead of the house next door -- combining an inexpensive Webcam and a free instant-messaging program has been an affordable way to set up videoconferences between computers. Now the Logitech QuickCam Fusion, with its 1.3-megapixel sensor and built-in microphone, aims to sharpen the video-chat picture and the sound without breaking the bank.
Available for $100 or less online, the QuickCam Fusion hangs over the top of the monitor and uses a high-speed U.S.B. 2.0 connection for video playback that can be much smoother than is possible with Webcams using the old U.S.B 1.1 connections. The camera's sensors and optical system produce clear pictures in low light, and its noise-canceling microphone suppresses those annoying echoes while video-chatting without a headset.
