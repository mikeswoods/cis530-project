The Cendant Corporation said yesterday that it would sell its Travelport unit, which owns Orbitz, Cheaptickets and other travel services, to the Blackstone Group for $4.3 billion in cash.
The deal, which is expected to close in August, was not unexpected. Last fall, Cendant, the travel and real estate conglomerate, said it planned to split into four independent businesses, either through sales or spinoffs. And Blackstone had long been rumored to be a bidder.
