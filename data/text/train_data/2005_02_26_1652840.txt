The Federal Communications Commission, in an abrupt about-face, has decided to reconsider a staff decision that allowed a prominent Oklahoma politician convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice to sell a group of radio stations, officials said on Friday.
The decision to approve the sale was considered by some media experts to be a significant deregulation of the broadcast ownership rules, because the agency has long required the forfeiture of radio licenses to the commission by those who fail a character test. The character test, which requires truthfulness in dealing with the government, is an integral part of the media rules, because owners of radio licenses hold a public trust and are obliged to act in ''the public interest.''
