It has been a bad year for data security.
The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a consumer advocacy group in San Diego, has counted 80 data breaches since February, involving the personal information of more than 50 million people. The sensitive data -- names, Social Security and credit card numbers, dates of birth, home addresses and the like -- have either been lost by or stolen from companies and institutions that compile such data.
