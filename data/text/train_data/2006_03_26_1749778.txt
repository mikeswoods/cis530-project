WITH three children and large extended families, Alisha and Sudhir Karandikar thought that their 1,800-square-foot house in San Jose, Calif., was too small. ''For holidays, we really need a formal dining room,'' Mrs. Karandikar, 35, said.
The solution took them well beyond an addition; they are building a 3,200-square-foot house from the old structure, with dining and family rooms, six bedrooms, three baths and a new kitchen, roof, facade, heating and plumbing. ''It's like a tear-down, but we're still sleeping in it,'' Mrs. Karandikar said by telephone as workers clattered around her.
