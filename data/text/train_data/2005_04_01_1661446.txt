Signaling its refusal to back down from a two-month bidding war, Qwest Communications International has once again raised its offer for MCI.
The fresh offer of $8.9 billion made yesterday comes two days after MCI's board tried to end the contest by accepting a $7.6 billion bid from Verizon Communications. Qwest's new bid would give MCI shareholders $27.50 a share, with $13.50 in cash and the rest in stock.
