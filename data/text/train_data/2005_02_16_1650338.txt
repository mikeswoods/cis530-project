Bill Gates said on Tuesday that Microsoft planned to introduce this summer a new version of its Internet Explorer Web browser with stronger features to protect against viruses and other vexing security flaws that have plagued Windows users.
In a speech at the RSA computer security conference, Mr. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said the company was making progress in its fight against spam, adding that ''phishing'' software scams were the fastest-growing security problem the company faced. He said the company was currently spending about $2 billion a year on computer security development and research.
