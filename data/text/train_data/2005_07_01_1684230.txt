Boeing's hiring of W. James McNerney Jr. as chief executive yesterday raised investor hopes that the company can wring bigger and more consistent profits from its operations and left 3M scrambling after Mr. McNerney's abrupt departure.
Boeing shares rose 7 percent yesterday, and 3M's fell 4.9 percent.
