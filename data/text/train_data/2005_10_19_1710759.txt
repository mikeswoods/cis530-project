The resurgence of Brooklyn neighborhoods like Park Slope and Williamsburg is well documented. But what is not as widely known is how well the downtown business district is doing, despite a still somewhat dog-eared appearance. What is more, the area is on the verge of a major transformation.
In the borough's six million square feet of Class A office space -- modern property in highly desirable locations -- the vacancy rate was only 6.8 percent in the third quarter of 2005; brokers say that is one of the lowest rates in the country. The Gallery at Fulton Street, more commonly known as the Fulton Mall, is regarded as a highly successful urban shopping center, commanding annual rents upward of $200 a square foot and drawing 100,000 shoppers a day. There is even a growing residential population in downtown Brooklyn.
