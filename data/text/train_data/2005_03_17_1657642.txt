General Motors' prediction of a loss in the first quarter and a new high for the price of crude oil were just too much for stocks yesterday, as the three main market gauges dropped 0.8 percent or more. European stock markets also fell on the news.
The stock market decline was led by economically sensitive stocks, including G.M. The automaker's struggles, along with oil at $56.46 a barrel, could be signaling a fall-off in consumer spending, which would mean slower economic growth and lower corporate earnings.
