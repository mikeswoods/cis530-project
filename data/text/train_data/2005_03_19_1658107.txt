At last month's Chicago Auto Show, the Honda Motor Company offered reporters a sneak preview of a Civic coupe. The car will not be available for sale until the fall, however, and for Honda executives that cannot come soon enough.
A look at recent sales figures for the current Civic shows why. After slumping 9.3 percent in January from a year earlier, Civic sales in the United States plummeted 34 percent in February, compared with February 2004. And analysts say sales of the vehicle, Honda's second-most popular after the Accord, could continue to slide through the summer.
