The Federal Communications Commission leveled a record $3.6 million fine yesterday against 111 television stations that broadcast an episode of ''Without a Trace'' in December 2004, with the agency saying the CBS show suggested that its teenage characters were participating in a sexual orgy.
The program was among nine cited yesterday for fines totaling about $4 million on agency accusations of violating decency standards between February 2002 and March 2005. The fines are the first indecency actions by the commission since Kevin J. Martin, a Republican, became chairman last March.
