I LOST the cartilage in both knees when I was 13 years old. My doctors told me, ''No more rugby,'' but I kept playing until I was 45. I'm 6 feet 3 inches tall, and I had the No. 8 position. That's the flanker who controls the ball at the back of the scrum. Let's just say it isn't the safest spot to be.
By the time I quit rugby, my knees were shot. I've had multiple operations, and I'm scheduled to go under the knife again in August.
