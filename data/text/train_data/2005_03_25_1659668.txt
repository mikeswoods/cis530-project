In an effort to steady Russia's business climate, President Vladimir V. Putin said Thursday that he favored a change in the law that would effectively end investigations into the privatizations of the 1990's.
Mr. Putin said he would support a law that would reduce the inquiries to 3 years from the current 10 years -- potentially clearing dozens of so-called oligarchs who gained their wealth in questionable asset sales. The law would end the possibility of inquiries into privatizations in the mid-1990's to late 1990's in oil, metals, cars and utilities.
