The Bush administration is proposing to allow foreign airlines and other foreign investors to control the management of airlines based in the United States, a move intended to attract capital to hard-pressed carriers.
Jeff Shane, a Transportation Department official, said the proposed rule change could have a profound impact on the airline business here and abroad, by lowering barriers to global investment. The proposal comes as the administration is also seeking to offer European nations some inducement to open their markets further to American airlines.
