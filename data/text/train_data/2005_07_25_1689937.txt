With its long reliance on talk formats and call-in programs, radio was arguably the first open-source media form. Now a new Public Radio International program, ''Open Source from P.R.I.,'' will test whether the collective intelligence permeating the Web can make not just loud radio, but smart radio. Not only does the program pull from unfiltered voices and opinions found on blogs, Open Source uses its own blog (www.radioopensource.org) to cull ideas and sources from its listeners.
Listeners are invited to make suggestions on Open Source's blog, where they are openly posted along with ideas from the program's five producers. When the comment flow starts and suggestions are made -- including recommendations for guests -- the audience can watch the program come together, sometimes over the course of a week, other times in an afternoon.
