A legal battle over nearly $20 billion of American International Group stock escalated yesterday, as lawyers for Maurice R. Greenberg, the company's former chief executive, argued in a lawsuit that the shares belonged to Starr International, which is headed by Mr. Greenberg, and not to A.I.G.
The lawsuit asks the court to recognize Starr International, which has provided long-term compensation to A.I.G. executives, as an independent entity. The suit contends that Starr has no contractual agreement to use its A.I.G. stock to compensate the insurance company's employees.
