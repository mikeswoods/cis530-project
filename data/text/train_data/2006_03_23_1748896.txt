Showing friends your photos on a big screen used to require nothing more than a slide projector and a screen (though a white wall would do). But showing digital photos that way has required either a portable player and a very expensive TV or a digital projector linked to a computer.
Now Panasonic has a compact three-pound digital projector that can show your photos on 38- to 300-inch screens without a computer hookup: just pop in an SD memory card (the most popular type) and it turns itself on and shows whatever images are on the card.
