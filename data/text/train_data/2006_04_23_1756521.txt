Luxury means different things to different people. To Stephen M. Case, a founder of AOL, who now runs a company called Revolution which invests in resorts, ''it's less about the trinkets and more about the experiences you take away.'' He will discuss his ''new definition of luxury'' on Tuesday at a conference in Carlsbad, Calif., sponsored by American Express, which publishes several luxury magazines.
A favorite among these experiences for Mr. Case, his wife, Jean, and their five children was a holiday at a vacation home in Costa Rica operated by Exclusive Resorts -- a Revolution company, of course -- during spring break in 2005.
