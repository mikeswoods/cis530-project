THE Wendy's fast-food chain, having been wrongly accused, now faces the task of rebuilding an image tainted by a woman's claim last month that she found a severed finger in her beef chili.
Marketing experts say the challenge is complicated by a certain lack of resolution: while the accuser, Anna Ayala, faces criminal charges for trying to defraud Wendy's, the origin of the finger she said she found is still not known.
