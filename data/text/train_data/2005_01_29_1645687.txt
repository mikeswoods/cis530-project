Mechanics at United Airlines have rejected wage and benefit cuts worth $96 million to the airline, which is operating under bankruptcy protection, their union said yesterday.
The union, the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, said a tentative agreement had been rejected overwhelmingly but did not give the margin. The union said mechanics also voted to strike if their contract was set aside by a bankruptcy judge.
