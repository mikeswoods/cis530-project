I'VE never sailed on a cruise ship. Four years in the United States Navy is the reason for that. Aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, a battleship -- I literally landed on them all at one point or another, and the effect lasted. Since then, when traversing an ocean, I have preferred to remain about 35,000 feet above the bounding main.
Actually, I'm in a solid majority in avoiding the high seas. True, cruises have become popular, carrying 10.5 million passengers last year, a record, including 8.9 million of them from ports in North America. That compares with 6.9 million passengers in 2000 and a mere 690,000 in 1975.
