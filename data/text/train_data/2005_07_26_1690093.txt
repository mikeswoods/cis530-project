Since the recall of 18 million Lipitor tablets in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration has been investigating how counterfeit Lipitor pills made their way into United States pharmacies.
Two years into that investigation, the government expects to seek an indictment against a large pharmaceutical distributor, according to court documents filed by the Justice Department in a related civil case.
