Like many part-time real estate investors, Fintan Murray, a Queens-based electrical contractor, used to buy only houses. He owns the single-family home in Whitestone where he lives as well as a two-family home in Maspeth and a three-family home in Woodside, which he rents out.
But two years ago, Mr. Murray realized that soaring housing prices were making it more difficult for him to collect enough rent to pay back a mortgage on a two- or three-family home, so he began looking for a moderately priced apartment building instead. The hunt paid off in August when he bought a 16-unit brick rental property in Sunnyside for $1.8 million. He has already started to renovate it.
