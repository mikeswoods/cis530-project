After two private equity firms announced the deal yesterday to buy the Neiman Marcus Group for slightly more than $5 billion, shareholders expressed their disappointment that the firms would get all the company's assets -- even the credit card business. Investors were clearly hoping for a separate, additionally lucrative sale.
Neiman's Class A shares fell on yesterday's announcement, closing at $92.96, down $5.36. ''The shareholders were hoping for another payday,'' said one executive involved in the deal.
