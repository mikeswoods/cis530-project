The Oracle Corporation raised its bid for Retek, a software maker, to $631 million late Thursday, leapfrogging the latest offer of $617 million from SAP and escalating the two-week-old bidding war.
Oracle, a maker of business and database software, increased its offer from $9 a share of Retek to $11.25 a share just a few hours after SAP, the global leader in the business software market, announced its ''best and final offer'' of $11 a share.
