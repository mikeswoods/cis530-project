NATURAL disasters often provoke sharp stock market declines where they occur, usually followed by recoveries that are almost as intense. Ten years ago this week, the Kobe earthquake in Japan sent stocks there tumbling 5 percent before they snapped back.
The Sri Lankan market followed a similar path after a tsunami struck on Dec. 26, but it was the exception. Despite the huge devastation, other markets in southern Asia had no big gyrations, and ended the ensuing week flat to higher.
