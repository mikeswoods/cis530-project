Newsweek said yesterday that it would tightly limit the use of unnamed sources in the wake of a retracted report about a Koran being flushed down a toilet at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba.
The magazine's two top editors, or other senior editors they designate, must approve articles with unidentified sources, Richard M. Smith, Newsweek's editor in chief, wrote in a letter to readers that appeared on its Web site and will run in the magazine this week.
