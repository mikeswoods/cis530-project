THE most-discussed Winter Olympics garb is always that of female figure skaters, as sportswriters titter over skirt length and sequin count. Far fewer words, however, are spent meditating on the skin-tight suits worn by alpine skiers. But in a sport where a few hundredths of a second can separate gold from also-ran -- and, in turn, determine whether a post-Olympics career will include endorsing pricey ski equipment or a local used-car lot -- aerodynamic clothing can make a real difference.
With that harsh reality in mind, the American, Canadian and Austrian skiers at this year's games -- which begin on Friday in Turin, Italy -- will be wearing new suits developed by Spyder Active Sports of Boulder, Colo. The suits look similar to those worn by American racers at the 2002 Winter Olympics; they are all shiny and stretchy. A microscope is required, literally, to spot some of the improvements over Spyder's previous version.
