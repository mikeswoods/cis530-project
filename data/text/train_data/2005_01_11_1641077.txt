Two British private equity companies are bidding jointly to buy Amadeus Global Travel Distribution, Europe's leading travel reservation company, for the equivalent of $5.7 billion. The deal could be completed this week, people close to the transaction said on Monday.
The battle for the company has been going on since last year with several suitors maneuvering to buy Amadeus, which is based in Madrid.
