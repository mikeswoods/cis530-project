Sears is adding some Latin flair.
In collaboration with Latina magazine, Sears, Roebuck & Company will introduce this fall a line of clothes, handbags and shoes designed with Hispanic women in mind. The collection, which will appear in 425 stores -- about half of all Sears stores -- is the biggest such introduction in recent history, said Gwen K. Manto, the company's executive vice president for clothes and accessories.
