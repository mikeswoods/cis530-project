Four major investment banks that helped sell WorldCom bonds to the public two years before the company collapsed agreed yesterday to pay a little more than $100 million to settle with investors who lost money in the deals.
Lehman Brothers, Credit Suisse First Boston, Goldman Sachs and UBS reached a proposed settlement with Alan G. Hevesi, the New York State comptroller and trustee of the state's Common Retirement Fund and lead plaintiff in the WorldCom securities class action.
