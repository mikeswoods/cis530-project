Intel, the world's largest computer chip maker, reported strong demand for its products on Tuesday, a day after a main Silicon Valley rival, Advanced Micro Devices, warned that it expected to report lower profits because of a price war with Intel in the flash memory market.
Intel said that its revenue was up nearly 10 percent in the fourth quarter, to $9.6 billion, while its profit dipped slightly, to $2.1 billion, or 33 cents a share, compared with $2.2 billion, also 33 cents, in the quarter a year earlier.
