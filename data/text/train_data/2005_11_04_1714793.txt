Ford, in partnership with the ethanol producer VeraSun Energy, plans to announce today that it will subsidize the installation of ethanol fuel pumps at gas stations around the Midwest. Ford also said it would increase the number of vehicles it builds that can burn fuel with as much as 85 percent ethanol.
In addition, Ford said it would work with dealers to emphasize the availability of ethanol-burning cars in areas where the fuel is sold.
