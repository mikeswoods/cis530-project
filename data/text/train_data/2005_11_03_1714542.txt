The chief executive of the Swiss drug company Novartis, Dr. Daniel L. Vasella, said on Wednesday that the company would consider building a vaccine production plant in the United States amid concern that its deal for the Chiron Corporation would leave the United States overly reliant on foreign companies for flu vaccine supplies.
Novartis won approval this week from independent directors of Chiron, the only major United States producer of flu vaccines, to buy, for $5.1 billion, the 58 percent of the company that it does not already own. The deal is still subject to approval by Chiron shareholders and government regulators.
