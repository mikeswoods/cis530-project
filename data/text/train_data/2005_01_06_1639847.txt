CAN the organizations behind ambitious campaigns intended to change behavior rather than sell products -- which helped put across concepts like the designated driver and a National Mentoring Month -- persuade baby boomers to consider becoming community volunteers as they begin looking at retirement?
That question is being asked as the Center for Health Communication at the Harvard School of Public Health begins an effort this week that includes advertising, events, the publication of a book and a public relations campaign, all aimed at promoting volunteerism. The Metropolitan Life Foundation donated almost $1.7 million to pay for the initial stages of the effort, aimed at the baby boomers, those 75 million to 77 million Americans born from 1946 to 1964.
