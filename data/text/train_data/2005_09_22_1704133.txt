The chairman of Time Warner, Richard D. Parsons, said yesterday that improving the company's America Online Internet business was a priority as he tries to bolster the share price -- signaling a tweak in strategy and a belief that the stigma of the AOL-Time Warner merger is finally a thing of the past.
Mr. Parsons indicated that amid pressure from Carl C. Icahn, the financier and Time Warner shareholder, he was ''looking real hard'' at moves like buying back more stock and increasing the dividend.
