ThyssenKrupp, the German steel maker, increased its offer for the Canadian steel maker Dofasco by 8 percent over the weekend in an apparent bid to hold off any further advances from a rival bidder, Arcelor.
In an announcement on Saturday, ThyssenKrupp said it would offer 68 Canadian dollars a share for Dofasco. Earlier it had matched Arcelor's second, hostile bid of 63 Canadian dollars. The latest move values Dofasco at 5.3 billion Canadian dollars, or about $4.5 billion.
