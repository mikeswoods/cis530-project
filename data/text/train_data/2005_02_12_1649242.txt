The Manchester United soccer club confirmed Friday that the American billionaire Malcolm Glazer has made a new bid for the club that involves less debt, but the club added that it was still unlikely to back his bid.
The board of Manchester United said Friday that Mr. Glazer's bid of Â£800 million ($1.5 billion), or 300 pence a share, set a fair price for the club. The board also said it would give Mr. Glazer limited access to its books. Though he has approached the club before, Mr. Glazer has never named a price.
