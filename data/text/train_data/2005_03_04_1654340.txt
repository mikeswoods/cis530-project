The boardroom and family battles at Cablevision Systems took a new turn yesterday as the company said it would delay shutting the Voom satellite television service to give Charles F. Dolan, the Cablevision chairman, more time to assemble a deal to buy the business.
Another twist emerged later in the day, when an independent committee of directors accused Mr. Dolan of expanding Voom through his newly created Web site in violation of his agreement with Cablevision. A letter from the committee said it was ''imperative that the expansion of the business stop immediately.''
