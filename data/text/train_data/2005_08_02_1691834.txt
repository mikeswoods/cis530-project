The Bush administration announced plans Monday to seek a broad agreement with China to limit its clothing exports to the United States.
The announcement was a partial payoff of promises that the administration made last week to House Republicans from Alabama and North Carolina to win approval of the Central American Free Trade Agreement. But some trade experts said the announcement was broader than they had expected and could lead to higher prices for socks, shirts, skirts, trousers, swimwear and many other categories of clothing.
