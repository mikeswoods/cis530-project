NEITHER the outcry over the content of Super Bowl commercials last year nor the fallout from the episode involving Janet Jackson during the halftime show have deterred a lengthy list of blue-chip marketers from signing up as sponsors this year.
Still, the advertisers, which are paying record prices to appear during the game to be broadcast by Fox on Feb. 6, are paying close attention to the tone and tenor of their commercials. The marketers, which include Anheuser-Busch, Ford Motor, General Motors and McDonald's, are anxious to avoid a repeat of the vociferous complaints generated by last year's spots. Some were centered on erectile dysfunction, while others featured characters like a flatulent horse, a crotch-biting dog, a Scotsman who wore nothing under his kilt, a male monkey wooing a human female, an elderly couple fighting over a bag of potato chips and a man who mistakenly underwent a bikini-wax treatment.
