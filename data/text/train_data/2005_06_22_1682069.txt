Standing on the east bank of the Delaware River in this depressed town, next to boarded-up commercial buildings and an abandoned ferry pier, it is hard to imagine the time when the waterway was a playground for the rich and famous. But developers on both sides of the river are now hoping to turn back time with new projects that depend, in part, on an expansion of gambling in Delaware.
In the late 1920's, F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, lived in a riverside mansion called Ellerslie directly across the river on the Delaware side. There the Jazz Age couple held their notoriously wild house parties for literary friends.
