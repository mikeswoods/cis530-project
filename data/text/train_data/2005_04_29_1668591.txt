Three of the retired Morgan Stanley executives campaigning for the ouster of Philip J. Purcell met secretly with Morgan Stanley board members late last week and proposed splitting the company in two, according to people briefed on the meeting.
The talks were a major concession by Morgan Stanley's board, which has previously spurned repeated requests by dissident executives to meet. The executives proposed that Morgan Stanley divide into two companies -- one catering to institutions like pension and mutual funds and the other to individual investors. That would spell the end of Mr. Purcell's vision of Morgan Stanley as a diversified financial services firm.
