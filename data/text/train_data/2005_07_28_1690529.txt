The Royal Bank of Scotland, one of the world's biggest banks, is considering investing about $2.5 billion to acquire a stake in the Bank of China, according to a person briefed on the discussions.
The investment, which could be announced in weeks, would be one of the largest foreign investments ever in a Chinese bank, and the latest in a series of big overseas investments in the troubled but potentially lucrative state-owned sector.
