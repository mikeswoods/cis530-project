THE makers of ''The Da Vinci Code'' opened their film last week in spite of howls of protest from a historically powerful institution, which labeled the Sony Pictures effort ''a provocation'' and ''spirit-lowering tripe.''
The institution was the press, specifically the critics, who gave a C+ to an A-list enterprise that included Tom Hanks and Ron Howard. Sony Pictures did not treat the press much better, making minimal accommodations for reviewers, skipping the usual advance screenings and forcing critics to wait for a screening in Cannes the night before the film was released. Nothing like a jet-lagged press corps to rain on a parade.
