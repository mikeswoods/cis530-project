The BKF Capital Group, a publicly traded investment firm, said yesterday that it appeared to have lost a battle with a hedge fund looking to replace three board members.
BKF said a preliminary count at its annual meeting indicated that shareholders had voted to replace its chairman, John A. Levin, and two other directors, with a slate led by Warren G. Lichtenstein who runs Steel Partners, a $3 billion hedge fund firm. Mr. Lichtenstein said he would propose that Mr. Levin be appointed to a vacancy on the board.
