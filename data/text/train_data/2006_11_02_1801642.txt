Most customers at the Anthropologie store in SoHo come for the delicately woven knits and the ultrafeminine floral dresses. But these days at least some are coming for the books.
Last Sunday the merchandise and books were coordinated with near-perfect precision. Resting beside a black sweater ($68) and a jet-black skirt with orange embellishments ($118) were copies of Annie Leibovitz's ''A Photographer's Life: 1990-2005,'' big and black and gleaming, for $75. A pop-up book called ''One Red Dot'' echoed a display of polka-dotted canvas sneakers, while another title, ''The Persistence of Yellow,'' perfectly matched a strategically positioned yellow knit sweater.
