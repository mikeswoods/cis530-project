General Motors, closing out what could turn out to be the weakest first half of a year it has ever recorded, will offer zero percent financing on most 2006 models over the Independence Day weekend.
From Thursday to July 5, G.M. will offer six-year no-interest loans on all but the most popular Chevrolet, Buick, Pontiac and GMC vehicles in an effort to clear space on dealer lots for 2007 models. Five-year interest-free loans will be available to Cadillac, Saab and Hummer buyers, and three-year deals are planned for 2007 sport utility vehicles already on sale.
