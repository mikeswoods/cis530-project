FOR sci-fi movie fans, the opening titles of ''Alien,'' Ridley Scott's 1979 voyage through interstellar dread, perfectly evoke the film's ensuing themes. As a series of white rectangles gradually align to form the movie's title, the camera pans across the expanse of an enormous planet floating in the numbing, ominous, infinite void of outer space.
For visual effects aficionados, Coca-Cola's 1992 television commercial featuring Paula Abdul hoofing it with digitally inserted film clips of Groucho Marx and Gene Kelly presaged time-traveling lures of later award-winning works like the movie ''Forrest Gump,'' in which Tom Hanks was digitally transported into the Kennedy White House.
