Warner Brother Pictures has a tentative agreement to co-produce 25 movies with Legendary Pictures, a new production company financed by a consortium of Wall Street investors.
Legendary -- whose investors include, among others, AIG Direct Investments, Banc of America Capital Investors and Falcon Investment Advisors -- will put up $500 million, to be invested in a portfolio of films produced over several years. In addition to being a partner on projects produced by Warner Brothers, which is part of Time Warner, Legendary will develop its own movies as part of the venture.
