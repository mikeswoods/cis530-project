California's stem cell research program has arranged for a stopgap infusion of $14 million from philanthropic foundations started by some of California's wealthiest businesspeople.
The money will be used to keep the program going until the resolution of lawsuits challenging its constitutionality. The litigation has prevented the state from issuing any of the $3 billion in bonds authorized by voters to finance research on medical treatments using human embryonic stem cells.
