The Hertz Corporation, which last month withdrew a planned $2.50 booking fee after customers protested, has quietly embarked on another revenue-raising experiment by slashing its grace period for late vehicles in Europe and other international locations to 29 minutes from 59 minutes. Hertz, a unit of the Ford Motor Company, has also made formal a new currency exchange fee for certain overseas customers.
The new policy on returns, which goes into effect April 4, is aimed at achieving ''greater fleet flexibility and availability,'' according to a Hertz spokeswoman, Paula Stifter. It means that if customers show up more than 29 minutes late, they will be charged for another rental day. The changes affect travelers renting cars in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Ms. Stifter said. The grace period for United States rentals will remain 59 minutes.
